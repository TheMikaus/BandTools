# Quick Start Guide - PolyRhythmMetronome Android

Get started with the PolyRhythm Metronome on your Android device in 5 minutes!

## Installation

1. **Download the APK** to your Kindle Fire HD 10 or Android device
2. **Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"** in Settings (if not already enabled)
3. **Tap the APK file** to install
4. **Launch** the app from your app drawer

## Your First Rhythm Pattern

### Step 1: Set Your Tempo

The BPM (Beats Per Minute) controls how fast the metronome clicks.

**Option A - Use Presets:**
Tap one of the preset buttons for common tempos:
- `60` - Very slow (ballad tempo)
- `100` - Moderate
- `120` - Standard practice tempo ‚≠ê (recommended to start)
- `140` - Faster
- `180` - Very fast

**Option B - Use Slider:**
Drag the slider to set any tempo from 40 to 240 BPM

### Step 2: Configure Left Ear (Blue Section)

The LEFT section controls what you hear in your left ear:

1. **Subdivision** - How many clicks per beat:
   - `4` = Quarter notes (one click per beat) ‚≠ê (start here)
   - `2` = Half notes (every other beat)
   - `8` = Eighth notes (two clicks per beat)

2. **Freq (Hz)** - The pitch of the click:
   - Default: `880` Hz (high pitch)
   - Lower numbers = deeper sound
   - Higher numbers = higher pitch

3. **Volume** - How loud this ear is:
   - Drag slider left to right
   - Default: middle position

4. **MUTE button** - Tap to silence this ear temporarily

### Step 3: Configure Right Ear (Red Section)

Same controls as left ear, but for your right ear:
- Try setting it to a different subdivision for polyrhythms!
- Default: `440` Hz (lower pitch than left)

### Step 4: Start Playing!

Tap the green **PLAY** button

- Watch for the **‚óè** indicators that flash with each beat
- Left indicator = left ear clicks
- Right indicator = right ear clicks
- Button turns red and says **STOP** while playing

To stop, tap the **STOP** button.

## Example: Simple 4/4 Time

Perfect for beginners:

1. Set BPM to **120** (tap the 120 button)
2. **Left ear**: 
   - Subdiv: `4` (quarter notes)
   - Keep other settings default
3. **Right ear**:
   - Subdiv: `4` (quarter notes)
   - Keep other settings default
4. Tap **PLAY**

You should hear a steady click in both ears at 120 BPM!

## Example: Simple Polyrhythm

Try 3 against 4:

1. Set BPM to **120**
2. **Left ear**: 
   - Subdiv: `4` (4 clicks per beat)
3. **Right ear**:
   - Subdiv: `8` (8 clicks per beat)
4. Tap **PLAY**

Notice how the ears play at different rates!

## Tips for Success

### üéµ Start Simple
Begin with both ears set to subdivision `4` to get familiar with the app.

### üîä Adjust Volume Balance
Use the volume sliders to make one ear louder if you're focusing on that part.

### üîá Use Mute Buttons
Mute one ear to practice just with the other, then unmute to add it back in.

### üëÇ Use Headphones
For best stereo separation, use headphones. The app plays different rhythms to each ear!

### üíæ Save Often
Save rhythm patterns you create so you can reuse them later.

### üì± Portrait Mode
Keep your device in portrait (vertical) orientation for the best layout.

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound?
- Check device volume
- Make sure neither ear is MUTED
- Try tapping STOP then PLAY again

### Want Different Pitches?
- Change the **Freq (Hz)** value
- Lower = deeper, Higher = higher pitch
- Try 220, 440, 880, 1760 for harmonic intervals

### App Not Responding?
- Close and reopen the app
- Your settings are auto-saved

### Want to Reset?
- Set both subdivisions to `4`
- Set BPM to `120`
- Set both frequencies to defaults (880 and 440)
- This gives you a clean starting point

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Experiment with Polyrhythms**: Try 3 against 4, 5 against 4, etc.
2. **Create Practice Patterns**: Save specific rhythms for different exercises
3. **Adjust Frequencies**: Find pitch combinations that work for you
4. **Use Accent Factor**: In advanced use, adjust how the first beat is emphasized
