# Version 1.2.0 User Guide - What's New

## Overview

Version 1.2.0 brings important bug fixes and UI improvements to make your metronome experience better. This guide highlights the key changes you'll notice.

---

## 🔧 Bug Fixes

### 1. Play Button Now Works Reliably

**What was wrong**: Sometimes the Play button wouldn't produce any sound, especially on fresh installations.

**What's fixed**: Audio playback is now more reliable. The app automatically installs the required audio library (simpleaudio) and falls back gracefully if needed.

**What you'll notice**: When you press PLAY, you should hear audio immediately, every time.

---

### 2. See Which Layer is Playing

**What was wrong**: The entire screen flashed on each beat, making it hard to tell which layer was actually playing.

**What's fixed**: Now only the specific layer that's playing flashes, just like the desktop version.

**What you'll notice**: 
- Each layer row lights up with its color when it plays
- You can easily track multiple layers playing at different times
- Much less distracting visual feedback

**Example**:
```
Before (v1.1):               After (v1.2):
┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
│ [Entire Screen]  │         │ LEFT Layers   [+]│
│                  │         ├──────────────────┤
│ *FLASH*          │         │ ⚡Layer 1 (flash!)│ ← Only this flashes
│                  │         │ Layer 2          │
│                  │         │ Layer 3          │
│                  │         └──────────────────┘
└──────────────────┘
```

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### 3. Better BPM Button Layout

**What changed**: BPM preset buttons are now arranged in a single row instead of two rows.

**Why it's better**:
- All 8 tempo presets visible at once
- Easier to find and tap the tempo you want
- More space for your layer lists

**Visual Comparison**:
```
Before (v1.1):                    After (v1.2):
┌────────────────────────┐       ┌────────────────────────┐
│ BPM: 120          [--] │       │ BPM: 120          [--] │
├────────────────────────┤       ├────────────────────────┤
│ ┌──┐ ┌──┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐ │       │ ┌┐ ┌┐ ┌──┐┌──┐┌──┐┌──┐ │
│ │60│ │80│ │100│ │120│ │       │ │6││8││100││120││140││160││
│ └──┘ └──┘ └───┘ └───┘ │       │ │0││0│└──┘└──┘└──┘└──┘ │
│ ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐┌───┐│       │ └┘ └┘ ┌──┐┌──┐         │
│ │140│ │160│ │180││200││       │        │180││200│        │
│ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘└───┘│       │        └──┘└──┘         │
└────────────────────────┘       └────────────────────────┘
      4 columns x 2 rows                8 columns x 1 row
```

**Note**: Buttons are taller but thinner in v1.2, making better use of screen space.

---

### 4. More Compact Layout

**What changed**: Reduced spacing between UI elements.

**Why it's better**:
- Less empty space means more room for your layers
- Easier to see more layers without scrolling
- Cleaner, more professional look

**What you'll notice**:
- Smaller gap between BPM buttons and layer lists
- More layers visible on screen at once
- Overall more efficient use of screen space

---

## 📱 How to Use the New Features

### Using Per-Layer Flashing

1. **Set Custom Colors**: Each layer has a color field (e.g., `#FF0000` for red)
2. **Press Play**: Watch as each layer flashes with its color when it plays
3. **Track Multiple Rhythms**: Easily see complex polyrhythm patterns

**Tips**:
- Use contrasting colors for layers that play at similar times
- Bright colors (#FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF) are easier to see
- Try the default colors: Blue (#3B82F6) for left, Red (#EF4444) for right

### Using the New BPM Layout

1. **Quick Tempo Selection**: All 8 presets (60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200) are now in one row
2. **Easier Tapping**: Taller buttons are easier to tap accurately
3. **Fine Tuning**: Still use the slider for precise BPM adjustments

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Getting the Most from Visual Feedback

**For Practice**:
- Start with one layer per ear to understand the flashing
- Gradually add layers with different colors
- Use the flashing to verify your rhythm is correct

**For Performance**:
- Choose colors that won't be too distracting on stage
- Test in your actual performance lighting
- You can always mute layers you don't need to see

### Organizing Your Layers

With more screen space now available:
- Keep similar subdivisions grouped together
- Use colors to categorize (e.g., blue for melodies, red for bass)
- Delete unused layers to keep the interface clean

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Audio Library

While audio reliability is improved, some devices may still have issues:
- **If you hear no sound**: Check device volume and app permissions
- **If audio stutters**: Close other apps to free up resources
- **If quality is poor**: Check your device's audio settings

### Visual Flashing

- Very fast tempos (200+ BPM) with many layers may cause visual lag on older devices
- Some colors may be harder to see in bright sunlight
- Flash duration is fixed at 120ms (not currently adjustable)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Update Your App**: If auto-update is enabled, you should receive v1.2 automatically
2. **Try the New Features**: Open your favorite rhythm patterns and see the new flashing in action
3. **Explore BPM Presets**: Use the one-row layout to quickly switch tempos

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Color Suggestions

Try these color combinations for different purposes:

**For Downbeat Tracking**:
- Layer 1 (÷1): `#FF0000` (bright red) - whole notes
- Layer 2 (÷4): `#FF6666` (light red) - quarter notes

**For Polyrhythm Practice**:
- 3-against-4: `#00FF00` (green) and `#0000FF` (blue)
- 5-against-7: `#FFFF00` (yellow) and `#FF00FF` (magenta)

**For Stereo Separation**:
- Left ear: Cool colors (`#0000FF` blue, `#00FFFF` cyan, `#00FF00` green)
- Right ear: Warm colors (`#FF0000` red, `#FF8800` orange, `#FFFF00` yellow)

### Performance Optimization

If you experience lag:
1. Reduce the number of layers (5-7 max per ear)
2. Avoid very fast subdivisions (÷16) at high tempos
3. Close other apps running in the background
4. Use simpler colors (solid primaries flash faster than complex colors)
