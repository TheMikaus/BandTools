# Bug Fix v1.5 - Test Plan

## Overview

**Version**: 1.5.0  
**Issue**: Tone feature doesn't work (drums do though)  
**Fix**: Corrected AudioTrack buffer size calculation for stereo audio

## Root Cause

The buffer size calculation in `_play_sound()` method used `len(audio_int16) * 2` which only counted the number of rows (samples) instead of total elements. For stereo audio with shape `(n, 2)`, this resulted in only half the required buffer size being allocated.

**Impact**: 
- Tones (~50ms, 2205 samples) failed to play correctly due to insufficient buffer
- Drums (~300-1200ms, 13230+ samples) still worked despite the bug due to longer duration

**Fix**: Changed to `audio_int16.size * 2` to correctly calculate total elements Ã— 2 bytes per int16.

## Test Environment

**Primary Test**: Android device with AudioTrack support  
**Secondary Test**: Desktop testing with simpleaudio fallback  
**Verification Method**: Manual testing with audio output

## Test Cases

### 1. Tone Playback Functionality

#### TC-1.1: Basic Tone Playback
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Description**: Verify that tone mode now produces audible output

**Steps**:
1. Launch the app
2. Ensure default layer is in "tone" mode (should be default)
3. Verify frequency is set (e.g., 880 Hz for left, 440 Hz for right)
4. Press the PLAY button
5. Listen for audio output

**Expected Result**:
- Tone plays from device speakers/headphones
- Left channel plays 880 Hz tone
- Right channel plays 440 Hz tone
- Tone is clearly audible
- Visual flash synchronizes with audio

**Status**: [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

#### TC-1.2: Multiple Tone Frequencies
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Description**: Verify tones work at various frequencies

**Steps**:
1. Create/modify layer to use tone mode
2. Test with frequency 220 Hz - press PLAY
3. Change to 440 Hz - press PLAY
4. Change to 880 Hz - press PLAY
5. Change to 1760 Hz - press PLAY

**Expected Result**:

2. Right: 2 drum layers (kick, snare) with different subdivisions
3. Press PLAY

**Expected Result**:
- All 4 layers audible
- Tones and drums mix properly
- No audio dropouts
- Timing remains accurate

**Status**: [ ] Pass [ ] Fail

### 4. Timing and Synchronization

#### TC-4.1: Tone Timing Accuracy
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Description**: Verify tone timing is accurate

**Steps**:
1. Set BPM to 60 (one beat per second)
2. Set tone layer to subdiv 4 (quarter notes)
3. Press PLAY
4. Use stopwatch/timer to verify timing

**Expected Result**:
- Exactly one tone per second
- No drift over 60 seconds
