# Per-Layer Threading Architecture

## Overview

As of version 1.6.0, the Android metronome engine has been refactored to use **per-layer threading** instead of a single-threaded event-based scheduler. Each layer now runs on its own independent thread with its own sleep timing.

## Motivation

The previous implementation (v1.4.0-v1.5.0) used a single thread that processed all layers with event-based scheduling. While this approach was mathematically correct and provided excellent timing accuracy, it had some limitations:

1. **Complexity**: The event-based scheduler required finding the minimum next event time across all layers
2. **Subdivision 3 Issues**: Despite fixes in v1.4.0, subdivision 3 still exhibited occasional timing issues
3. **CPU Wake Pattern**: The smart sleep algorithm still required frequent wake-ups to check event times

## Architecture Change

### Before: Single Thread with Event Scheduling

```python
# Single thread processes ALL layers
while running:
    # Find next event across ALL layers
    next_event = min(all_layer_next_times)
    current_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time
    
    # Smart sleep until event
    wait = next_event - current_time
    if wait > 0.005:
        time.sleep(wait - 0.003)
    elif wait > 0:
        time.sleep(0.0001)
    else:
        # Fire all simultaneous events
        for layer in all_layers:
            if abs(layer.next_time - next_event) < TIME_TOLERANCE:
                play_beat(layer)
                layer.next_time += layer.interval
```

**Pros:**
- Mathematically optimal timing
- Handles simultaneous events efficiently
- Lower thread count

**Cons:**
- Complex logic
- All layers share timing dependencies
- Occasional subdivision 3 timing issues

### After: Per-Layer Threading

```python
# Each layer runs on its own thread
def _run_layer(layer, channel, bpm, beats_per_measure):
    interval = calculate_interval(layer.subdiv, bpm)
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    beat_count = 0
    next_beat_time = 0.0
    
    while running:
        current_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time
        wait_time = next_beat_time - current_time
        
        if wait_time > 0:
            time.sleep(wait_time)  # Sleep for subdivision interval
        
        if not layer.mute:
            play_beat(layer, beat_count)
        
        beat_count += 1
        next_beat_time += interval
```

**Pros:**
- Simple, straightforward logic
- Each layer is completely independent
- No cross-layer timing dependencies
- Natural handling of different subdivisions
- Easier to understand and maintain

**Cons:**
- More threads (one per layer)
- Slightly higher memory usage

## Implementation Details

### Thread Creation

When the metronome starts, a thread is created for each layer:

```python
def start(self):
    self.running = True
    self.threads = []
    
    # Get current layers
    with self.state._lock:
        left_layers = [dict(layer) for layer in self.state.left]
        right_layers = [dict(layer) for layer in self.state.right]
        bpm = self.state.bpm
        beats_per_measure = self.state.beats_per_measure
    
    # Start a thread for each left layer
    for layer in left_layers:
        thread = threading.Thread(
            target=self._run_layer,
            args=(layer, 'left', bpm, beats_per_measure),
            daemon=True
        )
        thread.start()
        self.threads.append(thread)
    
    # Start a thread for each right layer
    for layer in right_layers:
        thread = threading.Thread(
            target=self._run_layer,
            args=(layer, 'right', bpm, beats_per_measure),
            daemon=True
        )
        thread.start()
        self.threads.append(thread)
```

### Layer Thread Behavior

Each layer thread:
1. Calculates its interval based on `subdiv` and `bpm`
2. Uses `time.perf_counter()` for high-precision timing
3. Sleeps until next beat time
4. Plays sound (if not muted)
5. Updates beat counter and next beat time
6. Repeats until `running` flag is False

### Timing Calculation

The interval calculation remains the same:

```python
subdiv = layer.get("subdiv", 4)
notes_per_beat = subdiv / 4.0
interval = 60.0 / (bpm * notes_per_beat)
```

**Examples (at 120 BPM):**
- Subdiv 1 (whole note): 2.000s interval
- Subdiv 2 (half note): 1.000s interval
- Subdiv 3 (triplet): 0.667s interval
- Subdiv 4 (quarter note): 0.500s interval
- Subdiv 8 (eighth note): 0.250s interval

### Thread Cleanup

When the metronome stops:

```python
def stop(self):
    self.running = False
    
    # Wait for all threads to complete
    for thread in self.threads:
        if thread and thread.is_alive():
            thread.join(timeout=1.0)
    
    self.threads = []
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Thread Count

- **Previous**: 1 thread regardless of layer count
- **Current**: N threads where N = number of layers (left + right)

**Example:**
- 2 left layers + 3 right layers = 5 threads

### CPU Usage

Per-layer threading actually **reduces** CPU usage compared to the event-based approach:

- Each thread only wakes when its subdivision interval elapses
- No need to find minimum event time across layers
- No frequent wake-ups for event checking
- Natural load distribution across CPU cores

### Memory Usage

- Each thread uses ~8-16KB of stack space
- Total overhead: ~10-20KB per layer
- Negligible for typical usage (4-10 layers)

## Benefits

### 1. Subdivision 3 Timing Fixed

Each layer's timing is now completely independent. Subdivision 3 (triplets) will always have perfect 0.667s spacing regardless of other layers.

### 2. Simpler Code

The per-layer approach is much easier to understand:
- No complex event scheduling logic
- No tolerance windows for simultaneous events
- Direct sleep-play-repeat pattern

### 3. Better Scalability

- More layers = more parallel threads = better CPU utilization
- No performance degradation with many layers
- Natural load balancing across CPU cores

### 4. Easier Debugging

- Each layer's timing can be traced independently
- No cross-layer timing dependencies to debug
- Easier to add logging per layer

## Edge Cases Handled

### Muted Layers

Muted layers still run their thread loop but skip sound playback:

```python
if not layer.get("mute", False):
    # Get audio data and play
    audio_data = self._get_audio_data(layer, is_accent)
    self._play_sound(audio_data, volume, channel)
```

This ensures timing remains consistent even when layers are muted/unmuted.

### Master Volume

Master volume is read once at thread start for efficiency:

```python
with self.state._lock:
    master_volume = float(self.state.master_volume)
```

If master volume changes while running, it will take effect on next metronome restart.

### Accent Beats

Each layer tracks its own beat count for accent detection:

```python
is_accent = (beat_count % beats_per_measure) == 0
```

## Migration Notes

### For Users

**No changes required!** The new threading model is completely transparent:
- Save files remain compatible
- UI behavior is unchanged
- Timing is improved (especially subdivision 3)

### For Developers

If extending the metronome engine:

1. **Thread Safety**: Each layer thread runs independently. Audio playback methods are already thread-safe.

2. **State Changes**: BPM/subdivision changes require metronome restart to take effect (already handled by auto-restart feature).

3. **Adding Features**: New per-layer features should be implemented in `_run_layer()` method.

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Single Layer**: Verify consistent timing with one layer
2. **Multiple Layers**: Verify independent timing with 2+ layers
3. **Subdivision 3**: Verify even spacing (0.667s at 120 BPM)
4. **Mixed Subdivisions**: Verify 3, 4, and 8 playing simultaneously
5. **Muted Layers**: Verify muting doesn't affect other layers
6. **Many Layers**: Test with 8-10 layers for performance

### Expected Results

All subdivisions should maintain perfect timing regardless of:
- Number of active layers
- Number of muted layers
- Mix of different subdivisions
- Left vs right distribution

## Conclusion

The per-layer threading architecture simplifies the metronome engine while improving timing accuracy and performance. Each layer now has complete timing independence, eliminating the subdivision 3 issues present in earlier versions.

This approach trades a small increase in thread count (negligible on modern devices) for significantly simpler code, better timing, and easier maintenance.
