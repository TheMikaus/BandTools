# Ticks Folder

This folder contains MP3 files that can be used as tick sounds in the PolyRhythmMetronome.

## File Naming Convention

MP3 files in this folder can be used in two ways:

1. **Single Sound**: A regular MP3 file will be used for all ticks
2. **Two Sounds**: Files named with `_1` and `_2` suffixes will be paired
   - Example: `click_1.mp3` and `click_2.mp3` will be treated as a pair
   - The first file is used for accented beats, the second for regular beats

## Adding Your Own Ticks

Simply place MP3 files in this folder. The application will automatically detect them and make them available in the sound mode selection.

## Example Files

You can add files like:
- `woodblock.mp3`
- `click_1.mp3` and `click_2.mp3` (paired)
- `cowbell_1.mp3` and `cowbell_2.mp3` (paired)
- `beep.mp3`
