# Google Drive Sync Feature

## Quick Start

AudioBrowser now supports cloud synchronization via Google Drive, making it easy to share practice sessions with your band members!

### 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

1. **Set up Google Drive credentials** (one-time, 5 min)
   - See [GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md)
   
2. **Click the Sync button** (☁ in toolbar)
   
3. **Choose your sync folder** (first time only)
   
4. **Select files to sync** (with checkboxes)
   
5. **Done!** Your band can now access your recordings and annotations

## What Gets Synced

### Automatically Synced (with your approval):
- ✅ Your annotations (`.audio_notes_YourName.json`)
- ✅ Song names (`.provided_names.json`)
- ✅ Duration cache (`.duration_cache.json`)
- ✅ Audio fingerprints (`.audio_fingerprints.json`)
- ✅ User colors (`.user_colors.json`)

### You Choose:
- 🎵 Audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`) - Select which recordings to share

### Never Synced:
- ❌ Backups (`.backup/`)
- ❌ Waveform cache (`.waveforms/`)
- ❌ Temporary files

## Key Features

### 🔒 Multi-User Support
- Each band member has their own annotation file
- You can see others' annotations (read-only)
- You can only modify your own annotations
- Shared metadata (song names, etc.)

### 📊 Version Tracking
- Smart version management prevents conflicts
- See what changed since last sync
- Incremental updates (no re-downloading everything)
- Operation history tracked

### ✓ Safety First
- Every operation requires your approval
- File-by-file selection with checkboxes
- All operations logged
- No automatic deletions

### ⚡ Efficient
- Only sync what you need
- Resumable uploads for large files
- Background operations (non-blocking UI)
- Smart file comparison

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to register an app with Google?
**A:** Yes, but it's your own personal "app" just for your band. Takes 5 minutes. See [GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md).

### Q: Is my data safe?
**A:** Yes! Your credentials stay on your machine, and you control what gets synced. All operations require your approval.

### Q: Can others edit my annotations?
**A:** No, each person's annotations are read-only to others. You can see them but not modify them.

### Q: What if two people sync at the same time?
**A:** Each upload creates a new version. The version system tracks changes. Last upload wins, but nothing is lost.

### Q: Do I need to sync every folder?
**A:** No, each practice folder syncs independently. Sync only what you want to share.

### Q: How much Google Drive space do I need?
**A:** Metadata files are tiny (KB). Audio files vary:
- MP3: ~3-10 MB per song
- WAV: ~30-50 MB per song
- 10-song practice session (WAV): ~300-500 MB

### Q: Can I use this with multiple bands?
**A:** Yes! Create different Google Drive folders for each band.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Delete token and re-authorize
rm token.json
# Then click "☁ Sync" again
```

### Can't Find Folder
```bash
# Check folder name spelling
# Or create a new folder with a different name
```

### Upload Fails
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f audiobrowser.log

# Common causes:
# - Network issues
# - File in use (close player)
# - Out of Google Drive space
```

### Python Package Issues
```bash
# Manually install packages
pip install google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client
```

## Development Notes

### Testing
```bash
# Run logic tests (no GUI needed)
python3 /path/to/test_sync_logic.py
```
