  - `.waveforms` folder no longer appears in the file browser
  - Matches existing behavior for `.backup` and `.backups` folders
  - Provides cleaner file organization by hiding system/cache directories
- **Stereo Backup File Location**: Stereo backup files created during mono conversion are now stored in `.backup` folder
  - When converting stereo files to mono, the original stereo file is now backed up to `.backup/{filename}_stereo.wav`
  - Previously stereo backups were created in the same directory as the audio file
  - Provides cleaner file organization by keeping all backups in dedicated backup folder

  - Marking a file as "Partial Take" appends "_partial_take" suffix to the filename
  - Unmarking removes the respective suffix from the filename
  - All metadata (annotations, provided names, durations) automatically updated after rename
  - Works from both Library tab (clicking indicators) and Annotations tab (checkboxes)
  - File system view refreshes automatically to show renamed files
  - Error handling prevents data loss if rename fails (reverts checkbox state)

### Changed
- **Batch Rename Filename Formatting**: Improved filename standardization in batch rename

  - Format: `##_lowercase_name_with_underscores.ext` (e.g., `01_my_song_name.wav`)
  - Previous format used spaces which are now replaced with underscores for better file system compatibility

### Fixed
- **Mono Export and Volume Boost File Handle Issue**: Fixed mono export and volume boost export failing due to locked file handles
  - Now properly releases media player file handle before attempting file rename operations
  - Calls `_release_media_for_path()` to clear QMediaPlayer source and wait for OS to release file locks
  - Prevents "Permission denied" or "file in use" errors on Windows during mono conversion and volume boost export

  - Eliminated excessive UI updates that were blocking the audio thread during playback
  - Resolves stuttering issue reported during normal playback (not during song selection)
- **Point Annotation Creation with Partial Clip Selection**: Clarified and documented the behavior when pressing Enter with only one clip boundary set
  - When only clip start OR only clip end is set (not both), pressing Enter now correctly creates a point annotation at the current timestamp
  - Clip annotations are only created when BOTH clip start AND clip end values are set

  - Smart enable/disable based on audio file channel count (only enabled for stereo files)
  - Seamless playback continuation when toggling channel muting during playback
  - Automatic cleanup of temporary channel-muted audio files on app close and startup

## Version Numbering Scheme

- **Major Version (1.x)**: Significant feature releases or architectural changes
- **Minor Version (x.N)**: Automatically incremented with each commit using `git rev-list --count HEAD`
- **Build Number**: Equivalent to minor version, represents total commit count
- **Commit Hash**: Short git commit hash for build identification (when available)

The version system ensures every commit results in a new version number for easy tracking and debugging.
