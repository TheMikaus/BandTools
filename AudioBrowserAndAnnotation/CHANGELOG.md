  - Mono file detection and checkbox state updates work properly without side effects
- **Audio Playback Stuttering During Playback**: Fixed stuttering that occurred during audio playback when just listening
  - Removed redundant `positionChanged` signal connection that was calling `_sync_slider()` excessively
  - `_sync_slider()` now only called by 200ms timer instead of on every position change (potentially hundreds of times per second)
  - Eliminated excessive UI updates that were blocking the audio thread during playback
  - Resolves stuttering issue reported during normal playback (not during song selection)
- **Point Annotation Creation with Partial Clip Selection**: Clarified and documented the behavior when pressing Enter with only one clip boundary set

  - Windows-only build pipeline for AudioBrowser executable
  - Triggers on changes to AudioBrowserAndAnnotation directory
  - Automatic version increment using existing git-based system
  - Build artifacts stored for 30 days, releases created on main branch
  - Uses existing build infrastructure (PyInstaller, version.py, audio_browser.spec)
- **Partial Take Checkbox in Annotations Tab**: Complete the partial take marking workflow
  - Added "Partial Take" checkbox next to "Best Take" checkbox in Annotations tab
  - Checkbox is enabled/disabled based on file selection state
  - State automatically saved to annotation data with proper integration
  - Checkbox state updates when switching between files 
  - Tooltip explains "Mark this song as a partial take"
  - Seamlessly integrates with existing multi-user annotation system

### Fixed
- **Autogeneration Silent Failure Bug**: Fixed issue where autogeneration would show "will start in 1 second" but then fail silently
  - Added comprehensive error handling and validation in `_start_auto_generation_for_folder()` method
  - Added validation for folder path existence, type checking, and directory verification  
  - Added proper error handling around file system operations (folder.glob() calls)
  - Added error handling for worker thread creation and startup processes
  - Added detailed error logging for all failure scenarios with descriptive status bar messages
  - Added logging of target folder path during boot autogeneration for better debugging
  - Ensures users now see clear error messages when autogeneration fails instead of silent failures
  - Prevents autogeneration from getting stuck in progress state when errors occur
- **Log File Readability**: Fixed unreadable log files caused by encoding and format string issues
  - Enhanced logging configuration with explicit UTF-8 encoding and error handling (`errors='replace'`)
  - Added proper handler cleanup to prevent conflicts with existing loggers
  - Used parameterized logging (`logger.info("%s", message)`) to avoid format string corruption
  - Improved `log_print` function with robust error handling and safe string conversion
  - Added fallback logging for critical errors to prevent silent failures
  - All existing log functionality preserved while ensuring files remain readable with proper timestamps
  - Prevents log file corruption from Unicode characters, file paths, or user content
  - Maintains proper one-entry-per-line log structure for better text editor compatibility
- **Major Performance Optimization for Song Selection**: Eliminated multi-second delays when selecting songs
  - Fixed WaveformWorker to avoid unnecessary full audio decoding for stereo detection
  - Optimized waveform caching to use lightweight channel count detection (0.06ms vs full decode)
  - Improved cache logic to accept entries without stereo metadata for backward compatibility
  - Enhanced stereo/mono mode switching to avoid regeneration when both are cached
  - Performance improvement: 11,688x faster (selecting 11 songs: ~32s ‚Üí ~0.003s)
  - Resolves issue where "loop across 11 elements should not take seconds"
- **Additional Performance Optimizations for Song Selection**: Further reduced selection delays
  - Added channel count caching to avoid repeated file I/O operations during selection
  - Optimized channel muting logic with early exit when both channels enabled (default state)
  - Deferred expensive UI state updates (mono button, channel muting) for unchanged file selections
  - Eliminated unnecessary function calls when both channels are enabled by checking state first
  - Cache automatically cleared when changing directories to prevent stale data
  - All `get_audio_channel_count()` calls now use cached version for consistency
- **Audio Playback Responsiveness**: Fixed song selection delay for immediate audio playback
  - Optimized channel muting checkbox state checking to avoid `hasattr()` overhead
  - Streamlined media player state transitions (stop ‚Üí setSource ‚Üí play)
  - Deferred expensive UI operations (waveform loading, annotation loading) after audio starts
  - Audio now starts playing within 10ms while heavy UI work happens asynchronously
  - Resolves user-reported issue where "clicking a song used to start right away" but had delays

## Version Numbering Scheme

- **Major Version (1.x)**: Significant feature releases or architectural changes
- **Minor Version (x.N)**: Automatically incremented with each commit using `git rev-list --count HEAD`
- **Build Number**: Equivalent to minor version, represents total commit count
- **Commit Hash**: Short git commit hash for build identification (when available)

The version system ensures every commit results in a new version number for easy tracking and debugging.

### Version Display Locations
- Application window title
- Help > About dialog
- Version module when run directly (`python version.py`)
