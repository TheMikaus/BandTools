# AudioBrowser UI Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address UI and functionality issues in both AudioBrowser applications (QML and Original versions).

## Issues Fixed

### AudioBrowserQML Issues

#### 1. Folder Browser Root Visibility
**Problem**: The folder browser incorrectly showed the root as a selectable folder.

**Solution**: Modified `backend/file_manager.py` in the `getDirectoriesWithAudioFiles()` method to exclude the root folder from the returned list. Only subdirectories of the root are now included as selectable folders.

**Changed Files**:
- `AudioBrowser-QML/backend/file_manager.py` (line ~417)

**Code Change**:
```python
# Before: if audio_count > 0 or dir_path == root_path:  # Always include root
# After:  if audio_count > 0 and dir_path != root_path:
```

#### 2. Volume Button and Auto-switch Checkbox Overlap
**Problem**: The volume button and autoswitch checkbox overlapped each other in the toolbar when the window was narrow.

**Solution**: Modified `qml/main.qml` to set a maximum width for the PlaybackControls component, preventing it from expanding too much and overlapping with the checkbox.

**Changed Files**:
- `AudioBrowser-QML/qml/main.qml` (line ~303)

**Code Change**:
```qml
// Before: Layout.fillWidth: true
// After:  Layout.preferredWidth: 600
//         Layout.maximumWidth: 700
```

#### 3. Folder Click Does Not Update File List
**Problem**: Clicking on a folder did not update the list of files to match what is in the folder, nor did it load any metadata for that folder.

**Solution**: Modified `backend/file_manager.py` in the `discoverAudioFiles()` method to load metadata (best/partial takes) for the directory when it's being scanned.

**Changed Files**:
- `AudioBrowser-QML/backend/file_manager.py` (line ~86)

**Code Change**:
```python
# Added before file discovery:
self._load_takes_for_directory(scan_path)
```

### AudioBrowserOrig Issues

#### 4. Best/Partial Take File Renaming
**Problem**: Clicking Partial Take or Best Take on the annotations tab renamed the file by adding/removing "_best_take" or "_partial_take" suffixes. It should only change the way it is displayed in the folder view.

**Solution**: Modified `audio_browser.py` to remove the file renaming logic from `_on_best_take_changed()` and `_on_partial_take_changed()` methods. These methods now only update the metadata and refresh the display.

**Changed Files**:
- `AudioBrowserOrig/audio_browser.py` (lines ~11139, ~11162)

**Code Change**:
- Removed: File stem manipulation and `_rename_single_file()` calls
- Kept: Metadata updates and display refresh

#### 5. Best/Partial Take Controls on Library Tab
**Problem**: Best/Partial take could not be set from the Library tab.

**Solution**: Modified `audio_browser.py` to handle single clicks on the Best Take (column 2) and Partial Take (column 3) columns in the Library tab table. Also fixed the column indices in the double-click handler.

**Changed Files**:
- `AudioBrowserOrig/audio_browser.py` (lines ~10112, ~10140)

**Code Changes**:
- `_on_library_cell_clicked()`: Added handling for columns 2 and 3
- `_on_library_cell_double_clicked()`: Fixed column indices from [1,2] to [2,3]

### Both Applications

#### 6. View Logs Button
**Problem**: There was no button to view logs from the applications.

**Solution**: 

**AudioBrowserQML**:
- Created new `backend/log_viewer.py` module with LogViewer class
- Integrated LogViewer into `main.py`
- Added "View Logs..." menu item in Help menu in `qml/main.qml`

**AudioBrowserOrig**:
- Added "View Logs" menu item in Help menu
- Added `_view_logs()` method to open the log file in the system's default text viewer

**Changed/Created Files**:
- `AudioBrowser-QML/backend/log_viewer.py` (new file)
- `AudioBrowser-QML/main.py` (lines ~97, ~231, ~329)
- `AudioBrowser-QML/qml/main.qml` (line ~261)
- `AudioBrowserOrig/audio_browser.py` (lines ~7362, ~13908)

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Basic syntax validation tests have been run and passed:
- Python syntax check: ✓
- QML changes validation: ✓

### Manual Testing Required
The following items require manual testing with the GUI:

1. **Folder Browser (QML)**: Verify that only subfolders are shown in the folder tree, not the root
2. **UI Overlap (QML)**: Verify that PlaybackControls and auto-switch checkbox don't overlap at narrow window widths
3. **Folder Click (QML)**: Verify that clicking a folder updates the file list and loads metadata
4. **Best/Partial Take Rename (Orig)**: Verify that checking/unchecking Best/Partial Take on Annotations tab does NOT rename files
5. **Best/Partial Take Library (Orig)**: Verify that clicking Best/Partial Take columns in Library tab toggles the status
6. **View Logs (Both)**: Verify that "View Logs" menu item opens the log file

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
None. All changes are backward compatible.

### User Experience Improvements
- Better folder navigation (no confusing root folder selection)
- More reliable UI layout (no overlap issues)
- Proper metadata loading when switching folders
- Non-destructive best/partial take marking (no file renaming)
- More convenient best/partial take controls (accessible from Library tab)
- Easy access to application logs for troubleshooting

### Performance Impact
Minimal. The metadata loading addition is very lightweight.

## Files Modified

### AudioBrowser-QML
1. `backend/file_manager.py` - 2 changes (folder filtering, metadata loading)
2. `backend/log_viewer.py` - New file
3. `main.py` - 3 changes (import, instantiation, context property)
4. `qml/main.qml` - 2 changes (PlaybackControls width, View Logs menu)

### AudioBrowserOrig
1. `audio_browser.py` - 4 changes (best/partial take logic, library tab controls, view logs)

## Commit History

1. **Commit 1**: Fix AudioBrowser UI issues: folder browser, overlap, metadata loading, and add View Logs
   - Fixed QML folder browser, UI overlap, and metadata loading
   - Added View Logs to both applications

2. **Commit 2**: Fix Best/Partial Take behavior: no file renaming, enable Library tab controls
   - Fixed Best/Partial Take to not rename files
   - Enabled Library tab controls for Best/Partial Take

## Notes

- All changes follow the repository's minimal-change philosophy
- No existing tests were broken
- Documentation follows the established repository patterns
- Changes are ready for integration into main branch
