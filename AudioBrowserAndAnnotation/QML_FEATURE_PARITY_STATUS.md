- Data binding (automatic updates)
- Modular architecture (reusable components)

### Development Velocity

Based on completed issues:
- **Average completion time**: 1-2 days per medium-complexity issue
- **Actual vs. estimated**: 5-7x faster than estimates (AI-assisted development)
- **Quality**: All completed features have comprehensive tests and documentation

**Projection for remaining work:**
- **High priority (Issue #1)**: 2 weeks (already partially complete in Phase 7)
- **Low-medium priority (Issues #9-12)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Low priority (Issues #13-19)**: 8-10 weeks

- **Essential features (Issues #1, #9-12)**: 4-5 weeks
- **Nice-to-have features (Issues #14-19)**: 6-8 weeks
- **Total for 100% parity**: 10-13 weeks

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Complete Issue #1: Batch Operations** - Highest priority missing feature
   - Enables efficient file management workflow
   - Unblocks many band practice scenarios
   - Users expect this functionality

### Short-Term (Next 4-6 Weeks)
2. **Complete Issues #9-12** - Quality of life improvements
   - Backup system (safety)
   - Workspace layouts (productivity)
   - Recent folders (convenience)
   - Missing shortcuts (power users)

### Medium-Term (Next 8-10 Weeks)
3. **Complete Issues #14, #18, #19** - Polish features
   - Export annotations
   - Enhanced preferences
   - Export best takes package

### Long-Term (As Needed)
4. **Consider Issues #13, #15-17** - Optional advanced features
   - Google Drive Sync (only if collaboration needed)
   - Documentation browser (if users struggle with external docs)
   - Now Playing panel (if users request it)
   - Undo/Redo (if users report accidental changes)

### Decision Point: 100% Parity vs. "Good Enough"

**Arguments for "Good Enough" (Current + Issues #1, #9-12):**
- ‚úÖ Current QML version is **production-ready** for band practice
- ‚úÖ Missing features are **optional** or **rarely used**
- ‚úÖ **Modern architecture** is easier to maintain and extend
- ‚úÖ **4-6 weeks** to complete essential features
- ‚úÖ Users can use AudioBrowserOrig for niche features (Google Drive sync)

**Arguments for 100% Parity (All Issues #1-19):**
- ‚úÖ No feature gaps compared to original
- ‚úÖ Complete migration means sunset of original codebase
- ‚úÖ All power-user workflows supported
- ‚ùå **10-13 weeks** additional development time
- ‚ùå Some features (Google Drive sync) rarely used
- ‚ùå Effort better spent on new QML-exclusive features?

**Recommendation:**

3. ‚úÖ All practice features work (DONE)
4. üöß Batch operations work (Issue #1 - IN PROGRESS)
5. ‚ùå Backup system works (Issue #9 - NEXT)
6. üöß Power-user features work (Issues #10-12 - QUICK WINS)

**Timeline to production-ready: 4-6 weeks from today**
