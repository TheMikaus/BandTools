## Key Metrics

### Lines of Code Analysis

| Category | AudioBrowserOrig | AudioBrowser-QML | Remaining Work |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Backend Modules** | ~16,290 lines | ~8,000 lines | ~8,000 lines |
| **UI Code** | ~16,290 lines | ~5,000 lines | ~2,000 lines |
| **Total Implementation** | 16,290 lines | 13,000 lines | ~10,000 lines |
| **Architecture Benefit** | Monolithic | Modular | Better maintainability |

**Note:** The QML version requires fewer lines of code due to:
- Declarative UI (less boilerplate)
- Data binding (automatic updates)
- Modular architecture (reusable components)

### Development Velocity

Based on completed issues:
- **Average completion time**: 1-2 days per medium-complexity issue
- **Actual vs. estimated**: 5-7x faster than estimates (AI-assisted development)
- **Quality**: All completed features have comprehensive tests and documentation

**Projection for remaining work:**
- **Low-medium priority (Issue #9)**: 1 week (Backup System only remaining essential feature)
- **Low priority (Issues #13-19)**: 8-10 weeks

**Realistic timeline with AI assistance:**
- **Essential features (Issues #1, #9-12)**: 4-5 weeks
- **Nice-to-have features (Issues #14-19)**: 6-8 weeks
- **Total for 100% parity**: 10-13 weeks

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Essential Features - COMPLETE!
**All essential features are now implemented in Phase 8:**
- ‚úÖ Backup System (Issue #9) - COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Auto-Generation Settings - COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Preferences Dialog - COMPLETE

### Short-Term (Next 2-3 Weeks - Optional)
1. **Complete Issue #19: Export Best Takes Package** - Nice workflow feature
   - Leverages existing Best Take indicators
   - Low-medium effort (3 days)
   
2. **Complete Issue #14: Enhanced Export Annotations** - Additional formats
   - Already has basic export, can add more formats
   - Low effort (2 days)

### Long-Term (As Needed)
3. **Consider Issues #13, #15-17** - Optional advanced features
   - Google Drive Sync (only if collaboration needed)
   - Documentation browser (if users struggle with external docs)
   - Now Playing panel (if users request it)
