## Features Removed for Simplification

These features were intentionally removed or simplified in the QML version:

### 1. Pagination (Library Tab)
- **Original**: Manual pagination for 500+ files with Previous/Next buttons
- **QML**: Removed - QML's ListView handles large datasets efficiently without pagination UI
- **Rationale**: Modern list virtualization makes pagination unnecessary

### 2. Undo/Redo System
- **Original**: Complex undo/redo for file operations
- **QML**: Not yet implemented
- **Rationale**: May be added later if needed, but not critical for initial release

### 3. Auto-Switch Checkbox (Toolbar)
- **Original**: Checkbox to auto-switch to first file in folder
- **QML**: Not implemented
- **Rationale**: Simplified workflow, may add if users request

### 4. Maximum Zoom Level
- **Original**: Zoom up to 16×
- **QML**: Zoom up to 10×
- **Rationale**: 10× is sufficient for most use cases

### 5. Now Playing Panel
- **Original**: Persistent collapsible panel with mini-waveform
- **QML**: Not implemented
- **Rationale**: Main playback controls serve this purpose; may add if needed

---

## Architecture Differences

### Simplifications in QML Version

1. **Monolithic → Modular**
   - **Original**: Single 16,290-line file
   - **QML**: Separated into ~15 backend modules + QML components
   - **Benefit**: Better maintainability and testability

2. **Imperative → Declarative UI**
   - **Original**: Manual widget creation and layout
   - **QML**: Declarative UI with automatic property binding
   - **Benefit**: Less boilerplate, easier to modify

3. **TableWidget → Models**
   - **Original**: QTableWidget with manual population
   - **QML**: QAbstractItemModel with automatic view updates
   - **Benefit**: Better performance, automatic updates

4. **Custom Painting → Canvas/PaintedItem**
   - **Original**: QPainter in paintEvent()
   - **QML**: QQuickPaintedItem with same painting code
   - **Benefit**: GPU acceleration, smoother rendering

5. **Worker Classes → Same**
   - **Original**: QThread-based workers
   - **QML**: Same QThread workers, just exposed to QML
   - **Benefit**: Code reuse, no re-implementation needed

## Conclusion

### Current State
The AudioBrowser-QML implementation has achieved **~55% feature parity** with the original, covering all core functionality:
- ✅ Audio playback
- ✅ File management
- ✅ Annotations
- ✅ Waveform display
- ✅ Clips
- ✅ Basic UI features

### Missing Features
The main missing feature categories are:
1. **Audio Fingerprinting** (entire subsystem)
2. **Google Drive Sync** (entire subsystem)
3. **Practice Management** (statistics, goals, setlists)
4. **Batch Operations** (rename, convert, export)
5. **Backup System**
6. **Advanced UI Features** (undo/redo, workspace layouts, Now Playing panel)

### Simplifications
Some features were intentionally simplified or removed:
- Pagination (not needed with QML's efficient list rendering)
- Maximum zoom reduced from 16× to 10×
- Now Playing panel (may add later)

### Recommendation
For **daily band practice use**, the QML version is **ready for core workflows**:
- Browse and play files ✅
- Create annotations ✅
- Create and export clips ✅
- Modern, responsive UI ✅

For **advanced users** needing:
- Fingerprinting
- Cloud sync
- Practice tracking
- Batch operations

...the **original version remains the recommended choice** until these features are implemented in QML (estimated Phase 7-11, 3-6 months of development).
