## Features Removed for Simplification

These features were intentionally removed or simplified in the QML version:

### 1. Pagination (Library Tab)
- **Original**: Manual pagination for 500+ files with Previous/Next buttons
- **QML**: Removed - QML's ListView handles large datasets efficiently without pagination UI
- **Rationale**: Modern list virtualization makes pagination unnecessary

### 2. Undo/Redo System
- **Original**: Complex undo/redo for file operations
- **QML**: Not yet implemented
- **Rationale**: May be added later if needed, but not critical for initial release

### 3. Auto-Switch Checkbox (Toolbar) ✅ Implemented
- **Original**: Checkbox to auto-switch to Annotations tab when selecting a file
- **QML**: ✅ Implemented (Phase 11)
- **Location**: Toolbar checkbox "Auto-switch to Annotations"
- **Behavior**: When enabled, double-clicking a file switches to Annotations tab automatically

### 4. Maximum Zoom Level
- **Original**: Zoom up to 16×
- **QML**: Zoom up to 10×
- **Rationale**: 10× is sufficient for most use cases

### 5. Now Playing Panel
- **Original**: Persistent collapsible panel with mini-waveform
- **QML**: Not implemented
- **Rationale**: Main playback controls serve this purpose; may add if needed

   - **Benefit**: Better maintainability and testability

2. **Imperative → Declarative UI**
   - **Original**: Manual widget creation and layout
   - **QML**: Declarative UI with automatic property binding
   - **Benefit**: Less boilerplate, easier to modify

3. **TableWidget → Models**
   - **Original**: QTableWidget with manual population
   - **QML**: QAbstractItemModel with automatic view updates
   - **Benefit**: Better performance, automatic updates

4. **Custom Painting → Canvas/PaintedItem**

   - **QML**: QQuickPaintedItem with same painting code
   - **Benefit**: GPU acceleration, smoother rendering

5. **Worker Classes → Same**
   - **Original**: QThread-based workers
   - **QML**: Same QThread workers, just exposed to QML
   - **Benefit**: Code reuse, no re-implementation needed
