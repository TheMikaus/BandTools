# Feature Summary: Workspace Layouts & Status Bar Progress Indicators

**Implementation Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Testing

---

## What Was Implemented

This implementation adds two high-value quality-of-life features to AudioBrowser:

### 1. üé® Workspace Layouts
**Save and restore your preferred window configuration**

- **Save Layout**: Ctrl+Shift+L or View ‚Üí Save Window Layout
- **Restore Layout**: Ctrl+Shift+R or View ‚Üí Restore Window Layout  
- **Reset Layout**: View ‚Üí Reset to Default Layout
- **Auto-Restore**: Saved layout automatically applied on startup

**Why This Matters**:
- No more resizing windows every time you open the app
- Optimize layout for your monitor and workflow
- Perfect for switching between laptop and desktop monitors
- Quick toggle between different workspace configurations

---

### 2. üìä Status Bar Progress Indicators
**Visual progress feedback for background operations**

- **Progress Bar**: Shows percentage completion (0-100%)
- **Progress Label**: Shows operation, file count, and current filename
- **Auto-Hide**: Disappears when operations complete
- **Non-Blocking**: Continue working while operations run

**When You'll See It**:
- Waveform generation (opening folders with audio files)
- Fingerprint generation (when auto-generation is enabled)

**Why This Matters**:
- Know exactly how long operations will take
- See which file is being processed (useful for debugging)
- Reduces anxiety during long operations on large folders
- Better UX than hidden background work or modal dialogs

## Quick Start Guide

### Using Workspace Layouts

1. **First Time Setup**:
   - Resize window to your preferred size
   - Adjust the splitter between file tree and content area
   - Press **Ctrl+Shift+L** to save
   - Your layout is now saved!

2. **Daily Use**:
   - Your saved layout automatically applies on startup
   - If you need to restore it manually: **Ctrl+Shift+R**
   - If you want to reset: View ‚Üí Reset to Default Layout

3. **Pro Tips**:
   - Save different layouts for different monitors
   - Use wide file tree for organization tasks
   - Use wide content area for detailed review work

### Understanding Progress Indicators

1. **What You'll See**:
   ```
   Status Bar (bottom-right):
   [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] Generating waveforms: 5/20 (MySong.wav)
   ```

2. **What It Means**:
   - **Progress bar**: Visual percentage (5/20 = 25% complete)
   - **Operation name**: What's happening (waveforms or fingerprints)
   - **File count**: Current/Total files being processed
   - **Filename**: The specific file being processed right now

3. **When It Appears**:
   - Opening folders with many audio files (first time)
   - When auto-generation is enabled in settings
   - During manual fingerprint generation

- ‚úÖ Clear visual progress for all background operations
- ‚úÖ See exactly which file is being processed
- ‚úÖ Know how long operations will take (X/Y files)
- ‚úÖ Professional, polished user experience
