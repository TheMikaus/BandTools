# Implementation Summary: Tempo & Metronome Integration

**Date**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Implement Tempo & Metronome Integration from INTERFACE_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md  
**Status**: âœ… Completed (Core Features)

---

## Overview

This implementation focused on implementing the **Tempo & Metronome Integration** feature (Section 3.3) from INTERFACE_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md. This is a high-impact, long-term feature that helps bands analyze timing and practice with visual tempo guides.

The Tempo & Metronome Integration allows users to:
1. Manually enter BPM (Beats Per Minute) for each song
2. View visual tempo markers (measure lines) on the waveform
3. Store tempo data persistently in JSON format
4. See measure boundaries based on 4/4 time signature

This feature addresses user needs for:
- Timing analysis during practice sessions
- Visual guides for identifying tempo issues
- Practice session organization by tempo
- Understanding song structure through measure markers

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. BPM Entry in Library Tab

**Description**: Editable BPM column in the Library table for setting tempo per song.

**Key Capabilities**:
- New "BPM" column between "Partial Take" and "Provided Name"
- Double-click to edit BPM value
- Validates input (1-300 BPM range)
- Displays as integer values
- Clear field to remove BPM
- Real-time saving to `.tempo.json`

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified `QTableWidget` to include 6 columns (was 5)
- Added BPM column with `ResizeToContents` mode
- Updated `_refresh_right_table()` to populate BPM values
- Enhanced `_on_table_item_changed()` to handle BPM editing with validation
- Updates waveform tempo markers when BPM changes

**Benefits**:
- Intuitive inline editing (same pattern as Provided Name)
- Immediate visual feedback
- Input validation prevents invalid values
- Tooltip provides helpful guidance

**Files Modified**:
- `audio_browser.py`: Library table initialization (~10 lines modified)
- `audio_browser.py`: Table population logic (~20 lines added)
- `audio_browser.py`: Item changed handler (~30 lines added)

### 2. Visual Tempo Markers on Waveform

**Description**: Measure boundary lines displayed on waveform based on BPM.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Vertical dashed gray lines at measure boundaries
- Assumes 4/4 time signature (4 beats per measure)
- Measure numbers every 4 measures (M4, M8, M12, etc.)
- Subtle design that doesn't interfere with other markers
- Safety limit of 1000 measures to prevent performance issues

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `_tempo_bpm` field to `WaveformView` class
- Added `set_tempo(bpm)` method to update tempo
- Enhanced `paintEvent()` to draw tempo markers
- Calculates measure intervals: `ms_per_measure = (60000 / bpm) * 4`
- Draws dashed lines with `Qt.PenStyle.DashLine`
- Positions measure numbers using small gray font

**Visual Design**:
- Color: Light gray (#888888) for subtlety
- Style: Dashed lines (distinguished from solid annotation markers)
- Width: 1 pixel (thinner than other markers)
- Labels: Gray text (#666666), 8pt Arial font
- Label frequency: Every 4th measure to avoid clutter

**Benefits**:
- Visual guide for timing analysis
- Helps identify tempo drift
- Makes song structure more visible
- Doesn't obscure waveform or other markers

**Files Modified**:
- `audio_browser.py`: `WaveformView.__init__()` (~3 lines added)
- `audio_browser.py`: `WaveformView.set_tempo()` method (~4 lines added)
- `audio_browser.py`: `WaveformView.paintEvent()` (~35 lines added)

### 3. Tempo Data Persistence

**Description**: BPM values stored in `.tempo.json` file per practice folder.

**Key Capabilities**:
- JSON structure: `{filename: bpm}`
- One file per practice folder
- Loaded automatically when folder is opened
- Saved automatically when BPM is changed
- Added to RESERVED_JSON set (excluded from sync/cleanup)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `TEMPO_JSON = ".tempo.json"` constant
- Added to `RESERVED_JSON` set
- Created `_tempo_json_path()` method
- Created `_load_tempo_data()` method
- Created `_save_tempo_data()` method
- Integrated into folder loading workflow

**Data Structure Example**:
```json
{
  "Song 1 - Take 3.mp3": 120,
  "Practice Jam.mp3": 140,
  "Slow Blues.mp3": 72
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Simple, human-readable format
- Easy to backup and transfer
- Per-folder isolation (no cross-contamination)
- Integrates with existing backup system

**Files Modified**:
- `audio_browser.py`: Constants and JSON set (~3 lines added)
- `audio_browser.py`: Helper methods (~20 lines added)
- `audio_browser.py`: Folder loading integration (~1 line added)

### 4. Waveform Integration

**Description**: Automatic update of tempo markers when playing songs or changing BPM.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Tempo markers appear automatically when song is played
- Update in real-time when BPM is changed in Library tab
- Clear when song has no BPM set
- Work alongside existing markers (annotations, loops, clip markers)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Created `_update_waveform_tempo()` method
- Integrated into `_play_file()` and `_deferred_annotation_load()`
- Calls `waveform.set_tempo()` with current file's BPM
- Triggers on BPM change in Library tab

**Benefits**:
- Seamless integration with existing playback workflow
- Real-time feedback when adjusting BPM
- No manual refresh needed

**Files Modified**:
- `audio_browser.py`: `_update_waveform_tempo()` method (~10 lines added)
- `audio_browser.py`: Integration in playback methods (~2 lines added)
- `audio_browser.py`: Integration in BPM editing (~2 lines added)
