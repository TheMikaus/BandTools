## Preferences Dialog

**Location**: File menu → Preferences

The Preferences dialog consolidates application settings in one convenient location:

### Current Settings

#### Undo Limit
- **Range**: 10 to 1000 operations
- **Default**: 100 operations
- **Purpose**: Controls how many undo operations are kept in history
- **Impact**: Higher values use more memory but provide more undo capability

- **Default**: Light
- **Purpose**: Controls the color scheme of the application
- **Impact**: Requires application restart to take effect

### How to Use
1. Open the **File** menu
2. Select **Preferences...**
3. Adjust settings as desired
4. Click **OK** to save (or **Cancel** to discard changes)

### Benefits
- Cleaner toolbar (undo limit spinner removed from toolbar)
- Centralized location for application preferences
- Easy to find and adjust settings
- Changes apply immediately and persist across sessions

---

## Toolbar Simplification

The main toolbar has been simplified to reduce clutter:

### What Changed
- **Removed**: Undo limit spinner (moved to Preferences dialog)
- **Kept**: Essential controls only
  - Undo/Redo buttons
  - Up navigation button
  - Auto-switch to Annotations checkbox
  - Sync button

### Benefits
- Less visual clutter
- More space for content
- Easier to focus on essential operations
- Settings accessible when needed via Preferences dialog

## Workspace Layouts

**Location**: View menu

Save and restore custom window configurations for different workflows:

### How to Use

#### Saving Your Layout
1. Resize the window to your preferred size
2. Adjust the splitter between file tree and content panels
3. Open the **View** menu
4. Select **Save Window Layout** (or press **Ctrl+Shift+L**)
5. Status bar confirms "Window layout saved"

#### Restoring Your Layout
1. Open the **View** menu
2. Select **Restore Window Layout** (or press **Ctrl+Shift+R**)
3. Window and panels return to saved configuration

#### Resetting to Default
1. Open the **View** menu
2. Select **Reset to Default Layout**
3. Window returns to 1360x900 with 40:60 panel ratio

### Features
- Saves window size and position
- Saves splitter position between file tree and content area
- Automatically restores saved layout on application startup
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick save/restore
- Easy reset to default if needed

### Why This Helps
- Optimize layout for your screen size and resolution
- No need to resize window every time you open the app
- Perfect for switching between different monitors or displays
- Create comfortable workspace that suits your review process
- Quick toggle between focused modes (wide file tree vs. wide content area)

### Use Cases
- **Large Monitor**: Save expanded layout to use all available space
- **Laptop**: Save compact layout optimized for smaller screen
- **Review Mode**: Wide content area for better waveform and annotation viewing
- **Organization Mode**: Wide file tree for easier file navigation

## Status Bar Progress Indicators

**Location**: Status bar (bottom-right of window)

Visual progress feedback for background operations:

### What You'll See
- **Progress Bar**: Shows percentage completion (0-100%)
- **Progress Label**: Shows operation name, file count, and current filename
  - Example: "Generating waveforms: 5/20 (MySong.wav)"
  - Example: "Generating fingerprints: 12/15 (AnotherSong.mp3)"

### When It Appears
- During automatic waveform generation (when opening folders)
- During automatic fingerprint generation (when enabled)
- During manual fingerprint generation from Library tab

### Features
- Real-time progress updates as each file is processed
- Shows current filename being processed
- Long filenames automatically truncated to prevent layout issues
- Auto-hides when operation completes or is canceled
- Doesn't interfere with other status bar messages
- Non-modal: you can continue working while operations run

### Why This Helps
- Know exactly how long operations will take
- See which file is being processed (useful if one file is problematic)
- Reduces uncertainty during long operations on large folders
- No need to wonder if the application is frozen or working
- Better user experience than hidden background operations

### Tips
- Progress is per-file, so fast files complete quickly
- Large folders (50+ files) will show progress for several minutes
- You can cancel operations if needed (progress indicates how much was done)
- Check progress label if a specific file seems to be taking too long

## Tips for Best Experience

### Recent Folders
- Use descriptive folder names for easy identification in the menu
- The most recently opened folder is always at the top of the list
- Recent folders persist between application sessions

### Preferences
- Adjust undo limit based on your workflow:
  - **Lower values (10-50)**: For lighter weight operation with less memory usage
  - **Medium values (50-200)**: Balanced approach for typical usage
  - **Higher values (200-1000)**: For complex editing sessions with extensive changes
- Choose theme based on your environment:
  - **Light theme**: Better for bright environments, traditional interface
  - **Dark theme**: Better for low-light conditions, reduces eye strain
- Settings are saved immediately when you click OK
- Theme changes require application restart to take effect

### Best Takes Export
- Export Best Takes Package regularly to create backups of your best recordings
- Use descriptive folder names so exported packages are easy to identify
- The SUMMARY.txt file in the export makes it easy to review what's included
- Share packages with band members who don't have the application installed

### Workspace Layouts
- Save your layout after finding comfortable window/panel sizes
- Different saved layouts can be useful for different monitors or display setups
- Use Ctrl+Shift+L frequently to update your saved layout as preferences change
- Reset to default if your layout becomes problematic or cluttered
- Saved layout persists across application sessions automatically

### Progress Indicators
- Watch progress during first-time folder opens (waveform generation)
- Use progress to estimate remaining time for large folder operations
- If a specific file seems stuck, the progress label shows which file is being processed
- Progress indicators are most useful for folders with 20+ audio files

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Many operations have keyboard shortcuts for even faster workflow. See **Help → Keyboard Shortcuts** for a complete list.
