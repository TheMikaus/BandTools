## Decision Matrix

### When to Use QML Version

✅ **Use QML if:**
- You need modern, responsive UI
- You want practice tracking features
- You need tempo/BPM analysis
- You want spectrogram visualization
- You need audio fingerprinting
- You can wait 2 weeks for batch operations

### When to Use Original Version

⚠️ **Use Original if:**
- You need Google Drive sync (niche use case)
- You cannot wait 2 weeks for batch operations
- You need undo/redo immediately (rare)

### When Both Will Be Equal

🎯 **After 4-6 weeks:**
- QML will have all essential features
- Only missing niche features (Google Drive sync)
- QML recommended for all users

---

## Conclusion: The Answer

### How much work remains?

**Short Answer:**
- **4-6 weeks** for production-ready (95% parity)
- **12-14 weeks** for full parity (100%)

**Recommended Path:**
- ✅ Complete high-priority features (4-6 weeks)
- ⏸️ Pause and gather user feedback
- 🤔 Only implement low-priority features if users request them

### Is QML ready for daily use?

**YES** - 95% ready today, will be 100% ready in 4-6 weeks

**Current readiness by use case:**
- ✅ Band practice: **95% ready** (only missing batch ops)
- ✅ Practice tracking: **100% ready** (all features complete)
- ✅ Audio analysis: **100% ready** (spectrogram, tempo, fingerprinting)
- ❌ Cloud collaboration: **0% ready** (no Google Drive sync)

### Should you aim for 100% parity?

**Recommendation: No, aim for 95%**

**Reasoning:**
- 95% covers all essential workflows
- Remaining 5% is niche features (Google Drive sync)
- Better to invest effort in QML-exclusive features
- Original version available for niche use cases

### Timeline Summary
