- **Purpose**: Controls the color scheme of the application
- **Impact**: Requires application restart to take effect

### How to Use
1. Open the **File** menu

## Workspace Layouts

**Location**: View menu

Save and restore custom window configurations for different workflows:

### How to Use

#### Saving Your Layout
1. Resize the window to your preferred size
2. Adjust the splitter between file tree and content panels
3. Open the **View** menu
4. Select **Save Window Layout** (or press **Ctrl+Shift+L**)
5. Status bar confirms "Window layout saved"

#### Restoring Your Layout
1. Open the **View** menu
2. Select **Restore Window Layout** (or press **Ctrl+Shift+R**)
3. Window and panels return to saved configuration

#### Resetting to Default
1. Open the **View** menu
2. Select **Reset to Default Layout**
3. Window returns to 1360x900 with 40:60 panel ratio

### Features
- Saves window size and position
- Saves splitter position between file tree and content area
- Automatically restores saved layout on application startup
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick save/restore
- Easy reset to default if needed

### Why This Helps
- Optimize layout for your screen size and resolution
- No need to resize window every time you open the app
- Perfect for switching between different monitors or displays
- Create comfortable workspace that suits your review process
- Quick toggle between focused modes (wide file tree vs. wide content area)

### Use Cases
- **Large Monitor**: Save expanded layout to use all available space
- **Laptop**: Save compact layout optimized for smaller screen
- **Review Mode**: Wide content area for better waveform and annotation viewing
- **Organization Mode**: Wide file tree for easier file navigation

## Status Bar Progress Indicators

**Location**: Status bar (bottom-right of window)

Visual progress feedback for background operations:

### What You'll See
- **Progress Bar**: Shows percentage completion (0-100%)
- **Progress Label**: Shows operation name, file count, and current filename
  - Example: "Generating waveforms: 5/20 (MySong.wav)"
  - Example: "Generating fingerprints: 12/15 (AnotherSong.mp3)"

### When It Appears
- During automatic waveform generation (when opening folders)
- During automatic fingerprint generation (when enabled)
- During manual fingerprint generation from Library tab

### Features
- Real-time progress updates as each file is processed
- Shows current filename being processed
- Long filenames automatically truncated to prevent layout issues
- Auto-hides when operation completes or is canceled
- Doesn't interfere with other status bar messages
- Non-modal: you can continue working while operations run

### Why This Helps
- Know exactly how long operations will take
- See which file is being processed (useful if one file is problematic)
- Reduces uncertainty during long operations on large folders
- No need to wonder if the application is frozen or working
- Better user experience than hidden background operations

### Tips
- Progress is per-file, so fast files complete quickly
- Large folders (50+ files) will show progress for several minutes
- You can cancel operations if needed (progress indicates how much was done)
- Check progress label if a specific file seems to be taking too long

## Now Playing Panel

**Location**: Below player bar, above tabs (main window)

The Now Playing Panel provides persistent playback controls and quick annotation entry that are always accessible, regardless of which tab you're viewing:

### How to Use

**Panel is always visible when you load a file:**
1. Select and play any audio file
2. The Now Playing Panel automatically updates with the file name
3. Use the controls in the panel to play/pause and add annotations
4. Click the ▼/▶ button to collapse/expand the panel

**Quick Annotation Entry:**
1. While playing a file, type your note in the text field
2. Press **Enter** or click **Add Note**
3. Annotation is added at the current playback position
4. The annotation appears in the Annotations tab (you can switch to verify)

### Features
- **Always Visible**: Panel stays visible regardless of which tab is active
- **Current File Display**: Shows currently playing file name with music note icon (♪)
- **Mini Waveform**: Visual progress indicator shows playback progress
- **Play/Pause Button**: Quick playback control synchronized with main player
- **Time Display**: Shows current position and total duration (e.g., "1:23 / 3:45")
- **Quick Annotation**: Add annotations without switching to Annotations tab
- **Collapsible**: Click ▼ to collapse panel, ▶ to expand it
- **Persistent State**: Collapsed/expanded state saved and restored across sessions
- **Seamless Integration**: Annotations added via panel work with undo, categories, etc.

### Why This Helps
- **Reduces Tab Switching**: Add annotations without leaving Library or Folder Notes tab
- **Faster Workflow**: Quick access to essential playback and annotation controls
- **Always Available**: Critical functions accessible from any tab
- **Unobtrusive**: Can be collapsed when not needed
- **Efficient Review**: Keep annotating while reviewing other information

### Tips
- Use the quick annotation field for short notes during initial review
- Switch to Annotations tab for more detailed annotations with categories and clips
- Collapse the panel if you need more screen space for other content
- Panel state (collapsed/expanded) is saved when you use "Save Window Layout" (Ctrl+Shift+L)
- Quick annotations are point annotations at the current playback time (not clips)

## Tips for Best Experience

### Recent Folders
- Use descriptive folder names for easy identification in the menu
- The most recently opened folder is always at the top of the list
- Recent folders persist between application sessions

### Preferences
- Adjust undo limit based on your workflow:
  - **Lower values (10-50)**: For lighter weight operation with less memory usage
  - **Medium values (50-200)**: Balanced approach for typical usage
  - **Higher values (200-1000)**: For complex editing sessions with extensive changes
- Choose theme based on your environment:
  - **Light theme**: Better for bright environments, traditional interface
  - **Dark theme**: Better for low-light conditions, reduces eye strain
- Settings are saved immediately when you click OK
- Theme changes require application restart to take effect

### Best Takes Export
- Export Best Takes Package regularly to create backups of your best recordings
- Use descriptive folder names so exported packages are easy to identify
- The SUMMARY.txt file in the export makes it easy to review what's included
- Share packages with band members who don't have the application installed

### Workspace Layouts
- Save your layout after finding comfortable window/panel sizes
- Different saved layouts can be useful for different monitors or display setups
- Use Ctrl+Shift+L frequently to update your saved layout as preferences change
- Reset to default if your layout becomes problematic or cluttered
- Saved layout persists across application sessions automatically

### Progress Indicators
- Watch progress during first-time folder opens (waveform generation)
- Use progress to estimate remaining time for large folder operations
- If a specific file seems stuck, the progress label shows which file is being processed
- Progress indicators are most useful for folders with 20+ audio files

### Now Playing Panel
- Use quick annotation for rapid note-taking during initial playback
- Collapse the panel when you need more screen space for tabs
- Panel is most useful when working in Library or Folder Notes tabs
- Quick annotations integrate with the main annotation system (visible in Annotations tab)
- Panel state is saved with workspace layouts (Ctrl+Shift+L)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Many operations have keyboard shortcuts for even faster workflow. See **Help → Keyboard Shortcuts** for a complete list.
