### Tips for Best Results

1. **Descriptive Names**
   - Use the "Provided Name" field to give songs descriptive titles
   - These names appear in the SUMMARY.txt file
   - Makes it easier to identify recordings later

2. **Add Annotations First**
   - Add your notes and comments before exporting
   - All annotations are included in the summary
   - Great for remembering what made each take special

3. **Regular Exports**
   - Export after each practice session
   - Build a library of your best work over time
   - Easy to track your progress

4. **File Organization**
   - Exported packages are self-contained
   - Can be shared via email, cloud storage, or USB drive
   - Recipients can read SUMMARY.txt without the application

### Sharing with Others

The exported package is perfect for sharing because:

- **No Software Required**: SUMMARY.txt can be read in any text editor
- **Standard Format**: ZIP files can be opened on any operating system
- **Audio Files Included**: Others can listen to the recordings
- **Complete Context**: Annotations provide context for each recording

### Importing Back

If you need to import the annotations back:

1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Copy the annotation files from `annotations/` folder
3. Paste them into your practice folder
4. Restart AudioBrowser or reload the folder

## Troubleshooting

### Dark Mode Issues

**Q: The theme didn't change after selecting Dark mode**
- A: Did you restart the application? Theme changes require a restart.

**Q: Some elements are hard to read in dark mode**
- A: Please report this as a bug! Include which specific UI element is problematic.

**Q: Can I auto-switch based on system theme?**
- A: Not yet, but this is planned for a future update.

### Export Issues

**Q: Export fails with "No Best Takes" message**
- A: Make sure you've checked the "Best Take" checkbox for at least one file in the Library tab.

**Q: Export is taking a long time**
- A: Large audio files take time to compress. The progress dialog shows status. You can cancel if needed.

**Q: Where are the exported files saved?**
- A: By default, they're saved in the parent folder of your practice folder. You can choose a different location in the save dialog.

**Q: Can I export Partial Takes too?**
- A: Not currently, but you could mark them as Best Takes temporarily for export.

**Q: The ZIP file is very large**
- A: Audio files (especially WAV) are large. Consider converting to MP3 first if file size is a concern.
