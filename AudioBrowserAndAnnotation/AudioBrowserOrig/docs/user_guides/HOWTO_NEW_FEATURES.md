### Tips for Best Results

1. **Descriptive Names**
   - Use the "Provided Name" field to give songs descriptive titles
   - These names appear in the SUMMARY.txt file
   - Makes it easier to identify recordings later

2. **Add Annotations First**
   - Add your notes and comments before exporting
   - All annotations are included in the summary
   - Great for remembering what made each take special

3. **Regular Exports**
   - Export after each practice session
   - Build a library of your best work over time
   - Easy to track your progress

4. **File Organization**
   - Exported packages are self-contained
   - Can be shared via email, cloud storage, or USB drive
   - Recipients can read SUMMARY.txt without the application

### Sharing with Others

The exported package is perfect for sharing because:

- **No Software Required**: SUMMARY.txt can be read in any text editor
- **Standard Format**: ZIP files can be opened on any operating system
- **Audio Files Included**: Others can listen to the recordings
- **Complete Context**: Annotations provide context for each recording

### Importing Back

If you need to import the annotations back:

1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Copy the annotation files from `annotations/` folder
3. Paste them into your practice folder
4. Restart AudioBrowser or reload the folder

## Troubleshooting

### Dark Mode Issues

**Q: The theme didn't change after selecting Dark mode**
- A: Did you restart the application? Theme changes require a restart.

**Q: Some elements are hard to read in dark mode**
- A: Please report this as a bug! Include which specific UI element is problematic.

**Q: Can I auto-switch based on system theme?**
- A: Not yet, but this is planned for a future update.

### Export Issues

**Q: Export fails with "No Best Takes" message**
- A: Make sure you've checked the "Best Take" checkbox for at least one file in the Library tab.

**Q: Export is taking a long time**
- A: Large audio files take time to compress. The progress dialog shows status. You can cancel if needed.

**Q: Where are the exported files saved?**
- A: By default, they're saved in the parent folder of your practice folder. You can choose a different location in the save dialog.

**Q: Can I export Partial Takes too?**
- A: Not currently, but you could mark them as Best Takes temporarily for export.

**Q: The ZIP file is very large**
- A: Audio files (especially WAV) are large. Consider converting to MP3 first if file size is a concern.

## Stereo Waveform View

AudioBrowser now automatically displays stereo audio files in stereo waveform mode, showing left and right channels separately for better visualization and editing of stereo content.

### How It Works

**Automatic Mode Switching**
- When you load a stereo audio file (2 channels), the waveform view automatically switches to stereo mode
- When you load a mono audio file (1 channel), the waveform view automatically switches to mono mode
- You can manually toggle between modes using the **Mono/Stereo** button above the waveform

### Waveform Display Modes

**Stereo View** (for stereo files)
- Waveform split into two sections: top half for left channel, bottom half for right channel
- Each channel displayed in a different color for easy identification
- Left channel: Blue/cyan color
- Right channel: Pink/magenta color
- Ideal for:
  - Identifying panning differences
  - Visualizing stereo effects
  - Detecting channel imbalances
  - Editing multi-tracked recordings

**Mono View** (default for mono files)
- Single waveform centered on the horizontal axis
- Shows combined audio signal
- Ideal for:
  - Simple recordings
  - Voice-only tracks
  - Mono instruments
  - Quick overview of audio content

### Channel Muting

**Selective Channel Playback**
- Available only for stereo files
- Check/uncheck **Left Channel** or **Right Channel** checkboxes above the waveform
- Muting a channel:
  - Creates a temporary audio file with that channel silenced
  - Maintains current playback position when toggling
  - Updates "Now Playing" text to show muting status (e.g., "Playing: song.mp3 (Left Muted)")
- Use cases:
  - Isolate individual instruments in stereo recordings
  - Practice with one part muted
  - Check balance and panning
  - Identify problematic channels

**Seamless Playback Continuation**
- When you toggle channel muting during playback:
  - Audio continues playing from the same position
  - New channel configuration takes effect immediately
  - No interruption in your workflow

### Manual Toggle

If you prefer a different view mode:

1. Click the **Mono** or **Stereo** button above the waveform
2. The button text indicates the current mode
3. The button is only enabled for stereo files (disabled for mono files)

### Tips

- Stereo view provides more detail but takes slightly more processing time
- Channel-muted files are cached in `.audiobrowser_temp` folder for quick switching
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up when you close the application
