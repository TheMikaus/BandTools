2. Add songs from any practice folder to a setlist
3. Reorder songs for performance sequence
4. Add performance notes (key changes, tuning, gear requirements)
5. Validate setlist readiness (check for Best Takes, missing files)
6. Calculate total performance duration
7. Export setlists to text format for printing/reference
8. Activate practice mode to focus on setlist songs

This feature addresses user needs for:
- Performance preparation and organization
- Song selection from multiple practice sessions
- Setlist validation before performances
- Professional documentation of performance sets
- Focused practice on upcoming performance material
