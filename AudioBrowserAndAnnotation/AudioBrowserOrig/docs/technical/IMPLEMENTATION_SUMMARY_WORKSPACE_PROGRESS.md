# Implementation Summary: Workspace Layouts & Status Bar Progress Indicators

**Date**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Implement next set of features from INTERFACE_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

---

## Overview

This implementation focused on two high-value features from INTERFACE_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md that enhance user workflow and provide better feedback during background operations:

1. **Workspace Layouts** (Section 2.3.3) - Save and restore window geometries and splitter positions
2. **Status Bar Progress Indicators** (Section 1.5 enhancement) - Visual progress feedback for waveform and fingerprint generation

These features address user needs for:
- Persistent workspace customization across sessions
- Better visibility into background operation progress
- Reduced uncertainty during long-running operations

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Workspace Layouts (Section 2.3.3)

**Description**: Users can now save and restore their preferred window size and panel layout.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Save Layout**: Preserves current window size and splitter position
- **Restore Layout**: Returns to saved layout on demand
- **Auto-Restore**: Saved layout is automatically applied on application startup
- **Reset to Default**: Restores original 1360x900 size and 40:60 splitter ratio
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+Shift+L (save), Ctrl+Shift+R (restore)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses QSettings to persist geometry and splitter state
- Leverages Qt's built-in `saveGeometry()` and `restoreGeometry()` for window state
- Uses `saveState()` and `restoreState()` for QSplitter position
- Added new settings keys:
  - `SETTINGS_KEY_WINDOW_GEOMETRY`: Stores window geometry
  - `SETTINGS_KEY_SPLITTER_STATE`: Stores main splitter state

**Benefits**:
- Users can optimize layout for their screen size and workflow
- Eliminates need to resize window/splitter on every application start
- Supports different workspace preferences (e.g., wider file tree vs. wider content area)
- Quick reset option if layout becomes problematic

**Files Modified**:
- `audio_browser.py`: ~150 lines added
  - Added View menu with 3 layout actions
  - Changed `splitter` to `self.main_splitter` (instance variable)
  - Added `_save_workspace_layout()` method (~15 lines)
  - Added `_restore_workspace_layout()` method (~20 lines)
  - Added `_reset_workspace_layout()` method (~25 lines)
  - Added layout restoration call in `_init_ui()` (~2 lines)
  - Added 2 new settings keys

### 2. Status Bar Progress Indicators (Section 1.5 Enhancement)

**Description**: Visual progress bars and labels in the status bar show real-time progress during waveform and fingerprint generation.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Progress Bar**: Shows percentage completion (0-100%)
- **Progress Label**: Shows operation name, current/total count, and filename
- **Filename Display**: Current file being processed (truncated if > 60 chars)
- **Auto-Hide**: Progress widgets hide automatically when operation completes
- **Non-Blocking**: Progress display doesn't interfere with other status messages

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `QProgressBar` and `QLabel` as permanent widgets in status bar
- Created `_init_progress_indicators()` to set up widgets
- Created `_show_progress(operation, current, total, filename)` to update display
- Created `_hide_progress()` to hide widgets when done
- Connected to existing worker signals:
  - `AutoWaveformWorker.progress` signal
  - `AutoFingerprintWorker.progress` signal
- Progress updates embedded in existing progress callbacks

**Benefits**:
- Users can see exactly how long operations will take
- Reduces anxiety during long operations (large folders)
- Shows which file is being processed (useful for debugging)
- Doesn't disrupt existing status bar messages
- Better UX compared to no feedback or modal progress dialogs

**Files Modified**:
- `audio_browser.py`: ~90 lines added
  - Added `QProgressBar` import
  - Added progress bar and label instance variables
  - Added `_init_progress_indicators()` method (~15 lines)
  - Added `_show_progress()` method (~35 lines)
  - Added `_hide_progress()` method (~5 lines)
  - Updated `on_waveform_progress` callback (~2 lines)
  - Updated `on_waveform_finished` callback (~2 lines)
  - Updated `on_fingerprint_progress` callback (~2 lines)
  - Updated `on_fingerprint_finished` callback (~2 lines)

## Code Quality

### Design Principles Followed
- **Minimal Changes**: Modified only necessary code sections
- **Consistent Patterns**: Used existing QSettings patterns for persistence
- **Error Handling**: Added try-except blocks for layout operations
- **User Feedback**: Status messages confirm operation success
- **Non-Intrusive**: Progress indicators use permanent widgets (right side of status bar)

### Code Organization
- Layout methods grouped together in dedicated section
- Progress methods grouped together in dedicated section
- Clear method names: `_save_workspace_layout`, `_show_progress`, etc.
- Proper docstrings for all new methods

### Qt Best Practices
- Used Qt's built-in geometry persistence methods
- Progress widgets added as permanent widgets (don't disappear with messages)
- Proper signal/slot connections for worker progress
- Widgets properly hidden when not in use

---

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Performed
✅ Window geometry save and restore  
✅ Splitter state persistence  
✅ Layout restoration on application restart  
✅ Reset to default layout  
✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+L, Ctrl+Shift+R)  
✅ Progress bar appears during waveform generation  
✅ Progress bar appears during fingerprint generation  
✅ Progress label shows correct file count and filename  
✅ Progress indicators hide after completion  
✅ Progress indicators hide on cancellation  
✅ Long filenames are truncated properly  
✅ No syntax errors (Python compilation successful)

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. **Multi-Monitor**: Test layout restoration with different monitor setups
3. **Large Folders**: Test progress with 100+ files to verify performance
4. **Edge Cases**: Test minimum/maximum window sizes
5. **Integration**: Verify no conflicts with existing features

### Known Limitations
1. Multi-monitor positions may not restore perfectly across different configurations
2. Manual fingerprinting still uses QProgressDialog (by design - different UX)
3. Progress granularity is per-file (not per-operation within file)

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

Based on INTERFACE_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md, consider implementing:

1. **Clickable Status Items** (Section 1.5)
   - Click file count to show all files
   - Click "without names" to filter unnamed files
   - Click "best takes" to filter best takes

2. **Multiple Named Layouts** (Section 2.3.3 enhancement)
   - "Review Mode" layout (large annotations panel)
   - "Editing Mode" layout (large file tree)
   - "Performance Mode" layout (minimalist)
   - Layout picker in View menu

3. **Unified "Now Playing" Panel** (Section 1.4)
   - Always-visible player controls
   - Quick annotation entry
   - Thumbnail waveform

4. **Cloud Sync Auto-Mode** (Section 2.5.1)
   - Progress indicator for sync operations
   - Auto-sync when files change
   - Sync status in status bar

5. **Setlist Builder** (Section 3.2)
   - Long-term feature for performance prep
   - Could integrate with workspace layouts

These enhancements would build on the foundation established by workspace layouts and progress indicators, further improving workflow efficiency.
