## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **Time Estimation**: Uses rough estimate (3 min/file) rather than actual playback time
2. **No Goal Editing**: Goals must be deleted and recreated to change
3. **No Goal History**: Expired goals hidden after 7 days
4. **No System Notifications**: Visual indicators only, no OS notifications
5. **No Goal Templates**: No preset goal configurations
6. **Per-Folder Goals**: Goals not shared across different root folders

### Future Enhancement Ideas

**Short-Term**:
- Goal editing capability
- Goal templates/presets
- Goal export/import

**Medium-Term**:
- Actual playback time tracking
- Goal history view
- System notifications
- Goal reminders

**Long-Term**:
- Goal analytics and trends
