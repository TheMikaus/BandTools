# Building AudioBrowser Executable

This directory contains scripts to build a standalone executable for the AudioBrowser annotation software.

## Quick Answer: Where is the Built Executable?

**For GitHub Actions builds** (automatic builds when you commit):
- ðŸš« **NOT in the repository** - the `dist/` folder is not committed
- âœ… **Artifacts section**: Repository â†’ Actions tab â†’ Workflow run â†’ Artifacts section (30 days)
- âœ… **Releases section**: Repository â†’ Releases section â†’ Download archives (permanent)

**For local manual builds** (when you run `build_exe.bat` or `build_exe.sh`):
- âœ… **Local `dist/` folder**: `dist/AudioFolderPlayer.exe` (Windows) or `dist/AudioFolderPlayer` (Linux/macOS)

## Automated Builds (Recommended)

**Pre-built executables are created on-demand** and available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/TheMikaus/BandTools/releases). Releases are created manually by the maintainer using GitHub Actions workflow dispatch. This is the easiest way to get a working executable without setting up a build environment.

### Where GitHub Actions Build Outputs Go

**The GitHub Actions workflow does NOT commit executables back to the repository.** Instead, built executables are stored in:

1. **GitHub Artifacts** (temporary, 30 days):
   - Go to: Repository â†’ Actions tab â†’ Select a workflow run â†’ Artifacts section
   - Download format: `AudioFolderPlayer-{version}-windows` (raw executable)

2. **GitHub Releases** (permanent, manually triggered builds):
   - Go to: Repository â†’ Releases section â†’ Latest release
   - Download format: 
     - Windows: `AudioFolderPlayer-{version}-windows.zip`  
     - Linux: `AudioFolderPlayer-{version}-linux.tar.gz`
     - macOS: `AudioFolderPlayer-{version}-macos.tar.gz`
   - Note: Releases are created manually by maintainers, not automatically on every commit

**Note**: You will NOT find the executable in the repository's `dist/` folder after GitHub Actions builds. The `dist/` folder is cleaned during the build process and only exists temporarily during the build.

## Manual Build (Development)

For development or customization, you can build manually using the scripts below:

## Quick Start

### Windows
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to the AudioBrowserAndAnnotation directory
3. Run: `build_exe.bat`

### Linux/macOS/Unix
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the AudioBrowserAndAnnotation directory  
3. Make executable: `chmod +x build_exe.sh`
4. Run: `./build_exe.sh`

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher installed and in PATH
- Internet connection (for automatic dependency installation)

## What the build scripts do

1. **Check Dependencies**: Verify Python is installed and install PyInstaller and PyQt6 if needed
2. **Generate Icons**: Create app_icon.png and app_icon.ico files using make_icon.py
3. **Clean Build**: Remove any previous build artifacts  
4. **Build Executable**: Use PyInstaller with the audio_browser.spec configuration to create a standalone executable
5. **Report Results**: Show the location and size of the built executable

## Output Locations

### For Manual/Local Builds

When you run `build_exe.bat` (Windows) or `build_exe.sh` (Linux/macOS) locally, the executable will be created at:
- Windows: `dist\AudioFolderPlayer.exe` 
- Linux/macOS: `dist/AudioFolderPlayer`

The executable is self-contained and can be distributed without requiring Python or other dependencies on the target system.

### For GitHub Actions Builds

When GitHub Actions builds the executable (automatically on commits), the executable is **NOT stored in the repository**. Instead, it's available as:

1. **Artifacts** (temporary): Actions tab â†’ Workflow run â†’ Artifacts section
2. **Releases** (permanent): Releases section â†’ Download the appropriate archive

The build process creates the executable in `dist/AudioFolderPlayer.exe` during the build, but this directory is not committed back to the repository.

## Troubleshooting

- **Python not found**: Install Python 3.7+ and ensure it's in your system PATH
- **Build fails**: Check that you have write permissions in the directory and sufficient disk space
- **Icon generation fails**: The build will continue without icons if make_icon.py fails
- **Missing libraries**: On Linux, you may need to install additional system packages for Qt graphics support

## File Structure After Build

```
AudioBrowserAndAnnotation/
â”œâ”€â”€ audio_browser.py          # Main application
â”œâ”€â”€ audio_browser.spec        # PyInstaller specification  
â”œâ”€â”€ make_icon.py             # Icon generation script
â”œâ”€â”€ build_exe.bat            # Windows build script
â”œâ”€â”€ build_exe.sh             # Cross-platform build script
â”œâ”€â”€ app_icon.png             # Generated app icon (PNG)
â”œâ”€â”€ app_icon.ico             # Generated app icon (ICO)  
â”œâ”€â”€ build/                   # Build artifacts (can be deleted)
â””â”€â”€ dist/                    # Final executable location
    â””â”€â”€ AudioFolderPlayer    # The built executable
```

## Notes

- The executable size is typically 100MB+ due to bundling Python and Qt libraries
- First build may take several minutes to download and install dependencies
- Subsequent builds are faster as dependencies are cached
- The build scripts work on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Automated CI/CD System

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds executables on every commit to main/develop branches. The workflow:

- **Builds for multiple platforms**: Windows, Linux, and macOS simultaneously
- **Creates artifacts**: Automatically uploads build artifacts for testing (30-day retention)
- **Creates releases**: Only when manually triggered via workflow dispatch  
- **Version management**: Uses git commit count for automatic version numbering

See [../.github/CI_CD_SETUP.md](../.github/CI_CD_SETUP.md) for detailed information about the automated build system.

**For end users**: Download pre-built executables from the [Releases page](https://github.com/TheMikaus/BandTools/releases) instead of building manually.
