# Implementation Summary: Practice Goals & Tracking

**Date**: January 2025  
**Issue**: Implement next set of features from INTERFACE_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

---

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive practice goal tracking functionality to AudioBrowser, allowing users to set, track, and achieve practice goals. This feature transforms the application from a passive review tool into an active practice management system that motivates consistent practice.

The feature implements Section 3.1.2 "Practice Goals" from INTERFACE_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md, building upon the existing Practice Statistics feature.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Practice Goal Types

**Weekly/Monthly Time Goals**:
- Set target practice time in minutes (e.g., "Practice 300 minutes this week")
- Automatically tracks time across all practice sessions in date range
- Uses rough estimation of 3 minutes per audio file
- Visual progress bar shows percentage complete
- Days remaining countdown

**Weekly/Monthly Session Count Goals**:
- Set target number of practice sessions (e.g., "Have 3 practice sessions this week")
- Counts practice folders within specified date range
- Helps maintain consistent practice schedule
- Perfect for building practice habits

**Per-Song Practice Goals**:
- Set song-specific practice targets (e.g., "Practice 'Song Title' 5 times this month")
- Tracks how many practice sessions included that specific song
- Helps ensure balanced repertoire practice
- Prevents neglecting difficult songs

**Per-Song Best Take Goals**:
- Set goal to record a best take for a specific song
- Binary completion (either have best take or don't)
- Encourages achieving performance-ready recordings
- Auto-completes when song is marked as Best Take

### 2. Goal Management UI

**Two-Tab Interface**:

**Active Goals Tab**:
- Displays all current goals with real-time progress
- Visual goal cards with color-coded progress bars
- Status indicators:
  - ✅ Green = Goal completed with celebration message
  - ⚠️ Red = Goal expired with warning
  - ⏰ Blue/Orange = In progress with days remaining
- Progress bars show percentage completion
- Detailed progress messages (e.g., "3 of 5 practices")
- Scrollable view for many goals
- Auto-hides expired goals older than 7 days

**Manage Goals Tab**:
- Goal creation form with dynamic fields
- Goal type dropdown with 6 options:
  - Weekly Time Goal
  - Monthly Time Goal
  - Weekly Session Count
  - Monthly Session Count
  - Song Practice Count
  - Song Best Take
- Context-sensitive form fields:
  - Song name input (enabled only for song goals)
  - Target value spinner (adapts suffix and default based on goal type)
  - Date range pickers with calendar popups
- Existing goals table showing all goals
- Delete button for each goal with confirmation dialog
- Input validation for all fields

### 3. Goal Progress Tracking

**Automatic Progress Calculation**:
- Integrates with existing `_generate_practice_folder_statistics()` method
- Analyzes practice folders to calculate current progress
- Progress updates every time goals dialog is opened
- No manual tracking required

**Progress Metrics**:
- Current value (e.g., minutes practiced, sessions completed)
- Target value (user-defined goal)
- Percentage completion (0-100%)
- Status (in_progress, complete, expired)
- Days remaining until goal deadline
- Detailed progress message

**Smart Status Detection**:
- In Progress: Goal is active and not yet complete
- Complete: Target reached (shows celebration)
- Expired: Deadline passed without completing goal
- Auto-filters expired goals after 7 days

### 4. Data Persistence

**Storage Location**:
- Goals stored in `.practice_goals.json` in root practice folder
- Each root folder maintains its own separate goals
- Goals persist across application restarts
- JSON structure is human-readable and editable

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "weekly_goals": [
    {
      "id": "unique-uuid",
      "type": "time",
      "target": 300,
      "start_date": "2025-01-01",
      "end_date": "2025-01-07",
      "created": "2025-01-01T12:00:00"
    }
  ],
  "monthly_goals": [...],
  "song_goals": [
    {
      "id": "unique-uuid",
      "song_name": "Song Title",
      "type": "practice_count",
      "target": 5,
      "start_date": "2025-01-01",
      "end_date": "2025-01-31",
      "created": "2025-01-01T12:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Manual Testing Performed

**Goal Creation**:
- ✅ All 6 goal types can be created
- ✅ Form validation works correctly
- ✅ Goals are saved and persist

**Progress Tracking**:
- ✅ Time goals calculate estimated time
- ✅ Session count goals count folders correctly
- ✅ Song practice goals count session occurrences
- ✅ Best take goals detect best take status

**UI/UX**:
