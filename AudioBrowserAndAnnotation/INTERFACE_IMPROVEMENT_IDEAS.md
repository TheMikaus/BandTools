## 1. Interface Improvements & Mouse Movement Reduction

### 1.1 Keyboard Navigation Enhancements ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Current State:**
- Some keyboard shortcuts exist (Undo/Redo, Alt+Up)
- Most operations require mouse clicks through menus or toolbar

**Improvement Ideas:**

1. **Global Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - `Space` - Play/Pause (like video players)
   - `Left/Right Arrow` - Skip backward/forward by 5-10 seconds
   - `Up/Down Arrow` - Previous/Next file in list
   - `J/K/L` - Rewind/Pause/Fast-forward (video editing standard)
   - `M` - Toggle mute
   - `N` - Add annotation at current playback position
   - `B` - Mark as best take
   - `P` - Mark as partial take
   - `Ctrl+Shift+R` - Batch rename
   - `Ctrl+E` - Export annotations
   - `Ctrl+F` - Focus search/filter box (see 1.2)
   - `1-9` - Jump to 10%, 20%, ... 90% of current song
   - `0` - Jump to beginning
   - `[` / `]` - Set clip start/end markers

2. **Tab Navigation:**
   - `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` - Cycle through tabs
   - `Ctrl+1/2/3/4` - Jump directly to specific tabs
   - `F2` - Rename currently selected file's provided name

3. **Annotation Shortcuts:**
   - `Enter` - Add annotation (when annotation text is focused)
   - `Ctrl+Enter` - Add "important" annotation
   - `Delete` - Delete selected annotation
   - `Alt+I` - Toggle annotation "important" flag

**Why:** Reduces hand travel between keyboard and mouse, speeds up repetitive tasks during long review sessions.

## 10. Conclusion

The AudioBrowser already has a strong foundation for band practice workflow. These ideas focus on:

- **Reducing friction**: Less clicking, more keyboard shortcuts
- **Enhancing collaboration**: Better multi-user features
- **Improving practice**: Tools focused on actual improvement, not just review
- **Scaling**: Support for years of recordings
- **Accessibility**: More ways to interact with the tool

Many of these ideas can be implemented incrementally, enhancing the existing workflow without disrupting current users. The key is maintaining the tool's focus: making weekly band practice review easier and more productive.

The most impactful improvements are those that reduce repetitive actions (keyboard shortcuts, batch operations, quick filters) and those that transform passive review into active practice management (goals, metrics, looping).
