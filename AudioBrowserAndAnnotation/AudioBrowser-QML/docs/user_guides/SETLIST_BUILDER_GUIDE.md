# Setlist Builder User Guide

## Overview

## Adding Songs to a Setlist

4. Notes are automatically saved as you type

## Validating a Setlist

The **Export & Validation** tab allows you to check your setlist for issues:

2. Select a setlist from the dropdown
3. Click **Validate Setlist**
4. Review the validation results, which include:

### Validation Status

## Tips and Best Practices

### Organizing Setlists

- **Use descriptive names**: Include date, venue, or purpose (e.g., "Blue Note Jazz Club - March 2024")
- **Create multiple versions**: Keep variations for different audiences or venues
- **Mark best takes first**: Validate before exporting to ensure you're using your best recordings

### Performance Notes

Use performance notes to capture:
- Key signatures and transpositions
- Tuning requirements (Drop D, DADGAD, etc.)
- Tempo changes or click track settings
- Special gear or effects needed
- Cues for band members
- Song transitions or medleys

### File Organization

- **Keep files organized**: Store practice recordings in dated folders
- **Use provided names**: Name your files meaningfully so they're easy to identify in setlists
- **Check for missing files**: Run validation before performances to catch any file issues

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently, the Setlist Builder does not have dedicated keyboard shortcuts. You can use standard dialog navigation:
- **Tab** - Move between fields
- **Enter** - Confirm dialogs
- **Esc** - Close dialogs

## Troubleshooting

### "This song is already in the setlist"

This means you're trying to add a song that's already in the setlist. Each song can only appear once per setlist.

### Red text and "âš  MISSING FILE" warning

The file no longer exists at its original location. Possible causes:
- File was moved or renamed
- Folder was deleted or moved
- File was on an external drive that's not connected

**Solution:** Remove the missing song and add the correct version from its new location.

### "No file selected" when adding songs

Make sure you've clicked on a song in the Library tab before clicking "Add Current Song" in the Setlist Builder.

## Data Storage

Setlists are stored in a `.setlists.json` file in your root practice folder. This file contains:
- All setlist definitions
- Song references (folder + filename)
- Performance notes
- Metadata (creation dates, UUIDs)

The file is automatically saved whenever you make changes. You can back up this file to preserve your setlists.

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:
- **Practice Mode**: Play through setlists automatically with playback controls
- **PDF Export**: Export setlists as formatted PDF files
- **Drag-and-drop reordering**: Drag songs to reorder them
- **Set breaks**: Add markers for breaks or intermissions
- **Print formatting**: Customizable print layouts
