## Quick Start

### Using the Sync Dialog

1. Launch AudioBrowser-QML

2. Open the Sync Dialog:
   - Menu: **Edit** â†’ **Cloud Sync...**

3. Select your preferred provider from the dropdown

4. Follow provider-specific setup instructions:
   - **Google Drive**: Click "Authenticate" and follow browser flow
   - **Dropbox**: Enter your access token
   - **WebDAV**: Enter server URL, username, and password

5. Select or create a remote folder

6. Upload or download files

## Common Features

All cloud providers support these features:

### Selective Sync
- Control what gets synced (audio files, annotations, metadata)
- Set maximum file size limits
- Annotations-only mode for low bandwidth

### Multi-User Collaboration
- Each user has separate annotation files
- Shared metadata across all users
- Prevent conflicts with user-specific files

### Sync History
- Track all sync operations
- View when files were uploaded/downloaded
- See which user performed each sync

### Version Tracking
- Backend tracks sync versions
- Helps detect conflicts
- Shows what changed between syncs

---

## Switching Between Providers

You can switch between cloud providers at any time:

1. Open the Sync Dialog
2. Select a different provider from the dropdown
3. Authenticate with the new provider
4. Select a folder on the new provider
5. Sync files

**Note**: Each provider stores files independently. Switching providers doesn't automatically migrate your files.

## Security & Privacy

### What Gets Synced:
- Audio files (.wav, .mp3, etc.)
- Annotation files (.audio_notes_*.json)
- Metadata files (.provided_names.json, etc.)

### What Never Gets Synced:
- Backup folders (.backup)
- Waveform cache (.waveforms)
- Git repositories (.git)
- Python cache (__pycache__)

### Authentication:
- **Google Drive**: OAuth 2.0 tokens stored locally
- **Dropbox**: Access tokens stored locally
- **WebDAV**: Credentials stored locally (encrypted recommended)

### Data Storage:
- Your files are stored according to each provider's terms
- WebDAV gives you full control if self-hosted
- All providers use HTTPS for transfer security

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Provider not available"
**Solution**: Install required Python packages:
```bash
# For Google Drive
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client

# For Dropbox
pip install dropbox

# For WebDAV
pip install webdavclient3
```

### "Authentication failed"
- **Google Drive**: Check credentials.json file location
- **Dropbox**: Verify access token is correct
- **WebDAV**: Check server URL, username, and password

### "No internet connection"
- Sync requires active internet connection
- Check your network settings
- Try again when online

### Sync is slow
- Large audio files take time to upload
- Consider using "annotations only" mode
- Set file size limits in sync rules
