# Phase 7 QML Migration - Additional Features Plan

## Overview

**Status**: ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS**  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Focus**: Additional features and functionality to approach feature parity with original audio_browser.py

Phase 7 builds on the completed Phases 1-6 by adding important features that were present in the original PyQt6 Widgets application but not yet implemented in the QML version.

## Estimated Effort

| Item | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Folder Notes | 2 days |
| Context Menus | 1 day |
| Batch Operations Backend | 3 days |
| Batch Operations UI | 2 days |
| File Metadata | 3 days |
| Practice Statistics | 2 days |
| Polish and Testing | 3 days |
| Documentation | 2 days |
| **Total** | **~18 days** |

**Calendar Time**: 4 weeks with testing and iteration

---

## Dependencies

- PyQt6 >= 6.5.0
- All Phase 1-6 features working
- Existing backend modules (AudioEngine, FileManager, etc.)
- Existing QML components

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Folder Notes tab (straightforward implementation)
- File context menus (standard QML feature)
- File metadata display (FileManager extension)

### Medium Risk
- Batch operations (requires careful testing for data safety)
- Batch rename patterns (need good validation)
- Multi-file operations (need progress tracking)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement extensive validation before file operations
2. Add preview functionality for batch operations
3. Implement rollback for failed operations
4. Comprehensive testing with test files
5. Clear error messages and user guidance

---

## Next Steps

1. Create FolderNotesManager backend module
2. Create FolderNotesTab QML component
3. Integrate into main.py and main.qml
4. Test folder notes functionality
5. Move to context menus implementation
6. Continue with batch operations
