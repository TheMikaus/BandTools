# Binding Loop Fix Summary

## Issue
The QML application was generating numerous binding loop errors and QColor assignment errors on startup.

## Root Cause
1. **Binding Loops**: Components declared properties with the same names as context properties, and main.qml tried to assign them (e.g., `batchOperations: batchOperations`), creating circular dependencies.

2. **QColor Errors**: Dialogs were using Theme property names that didn't exist (e.g., `Theme.primary` instead of `Theme.accentPrimary`).

## Solution

### 1. Removed Binding Loop-Causing Property Assignments
**File**: `qml/main.qml`

Removed property assignments from 8 components:
- BatchRenameDialog (batchOperations, fileManager)
- BatchConvertDialog (batchOperations)
- ProgressDialog (batchOperations)
- PracticeStatisticsDialog (practiceStatistics, fileManager)
- PracticeGoalsDialog (practiceGoals, practiceStatistics, fileManager)
- SetlistBuilderDialog (setlistManager, fileManager)
- ExportAnnotationsDialog (annotationManager, fileManager) - kept currentFile binding
- FingerprintsTab (fingerprintEngine, fileManager, fileListModel)

### 2. Added Theme Color Aliases
**File**: `qml/styles/Theme.qml`

Added 10 convenience property aliases:
```qml
readonly property color backgroundWhite: backgroundLight
readonly property color backgroundDark: backgroundColor
readonly property color textPrimary: textColor
readonly property color primary: accentPrimary
readonly property color success: accentSuccess
readonly property color danger: accentDanger
readonly property color warning: accentWarning
readonly property color info: accentInfo
readonly property color primaryDark: Qt.darker(accentPrimary, 1.2)
readonly property color highlightColor: accentPrimary
```

## Verification

Created `test_binding_loop_fixes.py` which verifies:
- ✓ No binding loops in all dialogs and tabs
- ✓ All Theme color aliases properly defined
- ✓ ExportAnnotationsDialog retains currentFile binding

All tests pass successfully.

## Expected Result
The application should now start without any binding loop warnings or QColor assignment errors. The console output should be clean of these messages:
- ~~QML ExportAnnotationsDialog: Binding loop detected for property "annotationManager"~~
- ~~Unable to assign [undefined] to QColor~~

## Files Modified
1. `qml/main.qml` - Removed 23 property assignment lines
2. `qml/styles/Theme.qml` - Added 10 property aliases
3. `docs/technical/BINDING_LOOP_FIXES.md` - Updated documentation
4. `test_binding_loop_fixes.py` - New comprehensive test file
