# Thread Cleanup Fix - Changelog Entry

## Date: 2025-10-17

## Issue
**"QThread: Destroyed while thread is still running"** warning when generating waveforms for multiple files

### Symptom
When selecting a folder with multiple audio files (e.g., 37 files), starting batch waveform generation, and then changing folders or closing the application before completion, the following error would appear:

```
qml: Selected folder: C:\Users\white\Desktop\DMG\2025-09-24
qml: Generating waveforms for 37 files in C:\Users\white\Desktop\DMG\2025-09-24
QThread: Destroyed while thread '' is still running
```

This warning indicated that QThread objects were being destroyed while their worker threads were still actively processing waveforms, which could lead to:
- Application crashes
- Resource leaks
- Undefined behavior
- Poor user experience

## Changes Made

### WaveformEngine Class (`backend/waveform_engine.py`)

#### 1. Added Destructor
```python
def __del__(self):
    """Cleanup method to ensure all threads are properly terminated."""
    self.cleanup()
```

#### 2. Added Public Cleanup Method
```python
@pyqtSlot()
def cleanup(self) -> None:
    """Clean up all running threads."""
    # - Cancels all active workers
    # - Requests all threads to quit
    # - Waits for threads to finish (up to 2 seconds each)
    # - Terminates unresponsive threads as last resort
    # - Clears all tracking dictionaries
```

#### 3. Enhanced Thread/Worker Lifecycle
- Changed from immediate deletion to scheduled deletion using `deleteLater()`
- Added proper cleanup in `_on_waveform_finished()`, `_on_waveform_error()`, and `_on_waveform_cancelled()`
- Ensures objects are deleted in the correct thread context

### WaveformWorker Class (`backend/waveform_engine.py`)

#### 1. Added Cancelled Signal
```python
cancelled = pyqtSignal(str)  # path - emitted when generation is cancelled
```

#### 2. Enhanced Cancellation Handling
- Worker now emits `cancelled` signal when cancellation is detected
- Signal triggers `thread.quit()` to gracefully stop the thread
- Prevents threads from remaining in running state after cancellation

## Testing

Created three comprehensive test suites:

1. **test_thread_cleanup.py** - Basic cleanup functionality tests
2. **test_batch_waveform_cleanup.py** - Batch generation scenario tests  
3. **test_cleanup_during_generation.py** - Active generation cleanup tests

All tests pass successfully with no QThread warnings.

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ⚠️ QThread destruction warnings when changing folders during waveform generation
- ⚠️ Potential crashes from improperly managed threads
- ⚠️ Resource leaks from threads not being cleaned up
- ⚠️ Poor responsiveness when user wants to change folders

### After Fix
- ✅ No QThread warnings
- ✅ Graceful cleanup of all threads
- ✅ Application can exit cleanly even with active waveform generation
- ✅ Users can change folders immediately without waiting
- ✅ Proper resource management
- ✅ Improved stability

## Usage

The fix is automatic - no changes needed in existing code. However, for explicit cleanup:

```python
# Clean up before major operations
waveform_engine.cleanup()
```

Or in QML:
```qml
onFolderChanged: {
    waveformEngine.cleanup()
    fileManager.setCurrentDirectory(newFolder)
}
```

## Files Modified

- `AudioBrowserAndAnnotation/AudioBrowser-QML/backend/waveform_engine.py`
  - Added `__del__()` destructor
  - Added `cleanup()` method
  - Added `cancelled` signal to WaveformWorker
  - Enhanced thread/worker lifecycle management
  - Added `_on_waveform_cancelled()` handler

## Files Added

- `AudioBrowserAndAnnotation/AudioBrowser-QML/test_thread_cleanup.py`
- `AudioBrowserAndAnnotation/AudioBrowser-QML/test_batch_waveform_cleanup.py`
- `AudioBrowserAndAnnotation/AudioBrowser-QML/test_cleanup_during_generation.py`
- `AudioBrowserAndAnnotation/AudioBrowser-QML/docs/technical/THREAD_CLEANUP_FIX.md`

## Technical Details

See [docs/technical/THREAD_CLEANUP_FIX.md](docs/technical/THREAD_CLEANUP_FIX.md) for comprehensive technical documentation including:
- Detailed root cause analysis
- Signal flow diagrams
- Implementation notes
- Usage guidelines
- Qt threading best practices

## Compatibility

- No breaking changes
- Backward compatible with existing code
- No changes required in QML files
- No changes required in application code (cleanup is automatic)

## Related Issues

This fix resolves the core threading issue that could manifest in several ways:
- Folder switching during waveform generation
- Application exit during waveform generation
- Rapid folder browsing
- Batch waveform generation for large directories
