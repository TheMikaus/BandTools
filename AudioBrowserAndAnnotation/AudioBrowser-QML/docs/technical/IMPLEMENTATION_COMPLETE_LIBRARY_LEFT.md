# Implementation Complete: Library Left Side Panel

## Issue Summary
Move the Library panel from the bottom of the screen to the left side, and condense the library and file folder controls into a smaller, more compact panel.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Layout Restructure (main.qml)
**Changed from:**
- Vertical layout (ColumnLayout) with Library at bottom
- Library took up ~40% of screen height
- Full width of screen

**Changed to:**
- Horizontal layout (RowLayout) with Library on left
- Library takes up 350px width (min 250px, resizable)
- Full height of screen
- Tabs on right side fill remaining ~70% of width

### 2. Library Panel Condensed (LibraryTab.qml)

#### Toolbar Simplification
**Before:** Two-row toolbar with 8+ buttons
- Row 1: Directory field, Browse, Refresh
- Row 2: Actions (Batch Rename, Convert), Filters (Best/Partial), Tools (Stats, Goals, Setlist)

**After:** Single compact row with 3 buttons
- 📁 Browse (icon button with tooltip)
- 🔄 Refresh (icon button with tooltip)
- ⋮ More menu (contains all actions, filters, and tools)

#### Folder/File Layout
**Before:** Horizontal split (side-by-side)
- Folders: 250px width on left
- Files: Remaining width on right

**After:** Vertical stack (top-to-bottom)
- Folders: 150px height on top (compact, scrollable)
- Files: Fill remaining height below

#### File List Simplification
**Before:** Full table with 4 columns
- Take indicators (★◐)
- File Name
- Library Name
- Duration

**After:** Compact list with 3 elements
- ★◐ indicators
- Filename (with ⭐ if has important annotation)
- Duration

#### Size Reductions
- Header heights: 32px → 24px
- Row heights: 32px/28px → 28px/24px
- Font sizes: fontSizeNormal → fontSizeSmall
- Margins: spacingNormal → spacingSmall
- Removed: Status bar at bottom
- Removed: Filter text field (search)
- Removed: Column headers with sorting
