# Waveform Display Fix - Technical Documentation

## Problem Statement
The waveform visualization in AudioBrowserQML was not displaying despite waveform data being generated successfully. This issue affected the AnnotationsTab where users need to see the audio waveform to add annotations and markers.

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing NOTIFY Signals
The `WaveformView` class in `backend/waveform_view.py` had properties defined without NOTIFY signals:

```python
# BEFORE (incorrect)
peaks = pyqtProperty('QVariant', _get_peaks, _set_peaks)
durationMs = pyqtProperty(int, _get_duration_ms, _set_duration_ms)
```

**Why this matters:** In PyQt6/QML integration, properties must have NOTIFY signals for QML to detect changes. Without NOTIFY signals:
- QML property bindings don't update when the Python property changes
- The `update()` call in the setter doesn't trigger QML to query the property again
- The waveform view never knows that new data is available

### 2. Missing Render Target Configuration
The `QQuickPaintedItem` wasn't configured with a render target, which could cause rendering issues on some platforms.

### 3. Potential QVariant Conversion Issues
The peaks setter compared nested lists directly, which might not work correctly when QML passes JavaScript arrays as QVariants.

## Solution

### 1. Add NOTIFY Signals
Added signals for property changes:

```python
# Signals
peaksChanged = pyqtSignal()  # Emitted when peaks data changes
durationMsChanged = pyqtSignal()  # Emitted when duration changes
```

Updated property definitions to include NOTIFY parameter:

```python
# AFTER (correct)
peaks = pyqtProperty('QVariant', _get_peaks, _set_peaks, notify=peaksChanged)
durationMs = pyqtProperty(int, _get_duration_ms, _set_duration_ms, notify=durationMsChanged)
```

### 2. Emit Signals in Setters
Modified setters to emit NOTIFY signals:

```python
def _set_peaks(self, peaks: List[List[float]]) -> None:
    # Convert QML/JavaScript array to Python list if needed
    if peaks is not None and not isinstance(peaks, list):
        try:
            peaks = list(peaks)
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            peaks = []
    
    # Normalize empty peaks
    if not peaks:
        peaks = []
    
    # Check if peaks actually changed (simple length check to avoid deep comparison)
    peaks_changed = (len(peaks) != len(self._peaks))
    
    # Update peaks
    self._peaks = peaks
    
    # Only emit signals and update if changed
    if peaks_changed:
        self.peaksChanged.emit()  # Notify QML of the change
        self.update()  # Request repaint
```

### 3. Configure Render Target
Added render target configuration in `__init__`:

```python
# Set render target to FramebufferObject for better compatibility
self.setRenderTarget(QQuickPaintedItem.RenderTarget.FramebufferObject)

# Enable antialiasing for smoother waveforms
self.setAntialiasing(True)
```

**Why this matters:**
- `FramebufferObject` provides better compatibility across different Qt Quick rendering backends
- Antialiasing improves visual quality of the waveform lines

## Data Flow

Here's how the waveform display works after the fix:

1. **User selects audio file** → `audioEngine.getCurrentFile()` changes
2. **WaveformDisplay.qml detects change** via `filePath` binding
3. **onFilePathChanged handler** calls `setFilePath(filePath)`
4. **setFilePath() function** checks if waveform is cached:
   - If cached: calls `loadWaveformData()`
   - If not cached: calls `generateWaveform()`
5. **WaveformEngine generates waveform** (in background thread)
6. **WaveformEngine emits waveformReady** signal
7. **WaveformDisplay receives signal** and calls `loadWaveformData()`
8. **loadWaveformData() sets peaks**:
   ```qml
   var peaks = waveformEngine.getWaveformData(filePath)
   waveform.peaks = peaks  // ← This now works!
   ```
9. **WaveformView._set_peaks() is called**:
   - Converts QML array to Python list
   - Checks if peaks changed
   - Emits `peaksChanged` signal
   - Calls `update()` to request repaint
10. **QML receives peaksChanged signal** and triggers property update
11. **paint() method is called** by Qt Quick
12. **Waveform is rendered** to screen

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Created `test_waveform_notify_fix.py` to verify:
- ✓ Python syntax is valid
- ✓ Required signals are defined
- ✓ Properties have NOTIFY parameters
- ✓ Signals are emitted in setters

### Manual Testing Required
Since this is a visual component, manual testing should verify:
1. Open AudioBrowserQML application
2. Navigate to Annotations tab
3. Select an audio file from the Library
4. Verify waveform appears in the waveform display area
5. Verify waveform updates when selecting different files
6. Verify playhead moves during playback

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix
- ✗ Waveform display area remains empty
- ✗ Only shows "No audio file selected" message or loading indicator
- ✗ Background and axis line visible, but no waveform peaks

### After Fix
- ✓ Waveform peaks visible as vertical lines
- ✓ Blue waveform color (Theme.accentPrimary)
- ✓ Center axis line (gray)
- ✓ Red playhead line during playback (Theme.accentDanger)
- ✓ Smooth antialiased rendering

## Technical Notes

### QML Property Bindings and NOTIFY Signals
From Qt documentation:
> "For a property to be used in a binding, it must have a NOTIFY signal. The NOTIFY signal is used to inform QML when the property value has changed, so that any bindings can be re-evaluated."

Without NOTIFY signals:
- One-time property queries work (e.g., initial read)
- Property changes from Python don't update QML bindings
- `update()` calls don't trigger QML to re-query the property

With NOTIFY signals:
- QML monitors the signal
- When signal emits, QML re-evaluates all bindings that use the property
- Automatic updates flow from Python to QML

### QVariant Type Conversion
When passing lists from QML to Python:
- QML arrays are QVariant-wrapped JavaScript arrays
- PyQt6 can usually convert automatically, but explicit conversion is safer
- Nested lists (List[List[float]]) work but need careful handling

### Render Target Options
`QQuickPaintedItem` supports three render targets:
1. **Image** (default) - renders to a QImage
2. **FramebufferObject** - renders to an OpenGL framebuffer
3. **InvertedYFramebufferObject** - FBO with inverted Y coordinate

We use FramebufferObject because:
- Better performance on GPU-accelerated systems
- More compatible with Qt Quick Scene Graph
- Required for some Qt Quick backends (e.g., RHI)

## Files Modified

- `backend/waveform_view.py` - Main fix implementation
- `test_waveform_notify_fix.py` - Automated test

## Related Code

The fix complements existing functionality:
- `backend/waveform_engine.py` - Generates waveform data (unchanged)
- `qml/components/WaveformDisplay.qml` - QML wrapper (unchanged)
- `qml/tabs/AnnotationsTab.qml` - Uses WaveformDisplay (unchanged)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future releases:
1. Add NOTIFY signals to other properties (positionMs, colors, bpm) for consistency
2. Add performance optimization for large waveforms
3. Add visual feedback during waveform generation
4. Add zoom/pan support with preserved waveform quality

## Conclusion

This fix addresses the core issue preventing waveform display by ensuring proper PyQt6/QML integration through NOTIFY signals. The implementation follows Qt best practices and maintains compatibility with the existing codebase.

The fix is minimal, focused, and doesn't change the existing API or data structures - it only adds the missing signals that enable proper QML property binding updates.
