# Python 3.13 Compatibility Fix

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to ensure AudioBrowser works with Python 3.13 and later versions.

## Problem

Python 3.13 removed the deprecated `audioop` module, which was used in both versions of AudioBrowser for audio sample format conversion. Specifically, the `audioop.lin2lin()` function was used to convert audio samples from various bit depths (8-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit) to the standard 16-bit format.

**Error encountered:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'audioop'
```

## Solution

Replaced the `audioop` module with a pure Python implementation that provides the same functionality.

### New Function: `convert_audio_samples()`

A new function was added to both applications that replicates the behavior of `audioop.lin2lin()`:

```python
def convert_audio_samples(data: bytes, old_width: int, new_width: int) -> bytes:
    """
    Convert audio samples from one width to another.
    Replacement for deprecated audioop.lin2lin().
    
    Args:
        data: Raw audio data as bytes
        old_width: Original sample width in bytes (1, 2, 3, or 4)
        new_width: Target sample width in bytes (1, 2, 3, or 4)
    
    Returns:
        Converted audio data as bytes
    """
```

### Implementation Details

The implementation:
1. Uses Python's `struct` module for binary data packing/unpacking
2. Handles all standard audio sample widths (8, 16, 24, 32-bit)
3. Properly scales sample values between different bit depths
4. Clamps values to prevent overflow
5. Maintains backwards compatibility with the original behavior

### Files Modified

#### 1. AudioBrowserOrig/audio_browser.py
- Added `import struct` to imports
- Added `convert_audio_samples()` function (67 lines)
- Removed `HAVE_AUDIOOP` check
- Changed `audioop.lin2lin(raw, sw, 2)` to `convert_audio_samples(raw, sw, 2)` (line ~1770)

#### 2. AudioBrowser-QML/backend/waveform_engine.py
- Changed `import audioop` to `import struct`
- Added `convert_audio_samples()` function (67 lines)
- Changed `audioop.lin2lin(raw, sw, 2)` to `convert_audio_samples(raw, sw, 2)` (line ~172)

## Testing

The new implementation was tested with:
- 8-bit to 16-bit conversion
- 16-bit to 16-bit (no-op)
- 32-bit to 16-bit conversion
- 16-bit to 8-bit conversion

All conversions work correctly with proper value scaling and clamping.

## Benefits

1. **Python 3.13+ Compatibility**: Application now works with Python 3.13 and future versions
2. **No External Dependencies**: Removes dependency on deprecated module
3. **Pure Python**: Implementation is portable and doesn't require compiled extensions
4. **Transparent Replacement**: No changes to application behavior or functionality
5. **Maintainability**: Code is self-contained and easier to maintain

## Backwards Compatibility

The changes are fully backwards compatible:
- Works with Python 3.7 through 3.13+
- No changes to application behavior
- No changes to file formats or data structures
- Existing audio files and metadata continue to work

## Performance

The pure Python implementation has comparable performance to the original `audioop` module for the application's use case (loading audio files once for waveform generation). Any performance difference is negligible compared to file I/O and waveform computation time.

## Future Considerations

This fix is complete and requires no additional work. The pure Python implementation will continue to work in all future Python versions.
