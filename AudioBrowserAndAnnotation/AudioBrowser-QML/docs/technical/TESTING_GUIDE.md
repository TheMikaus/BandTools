# AudioBrowser QML - Testing Guide

This guide provides instructions for testing the AudioBrowser QML application to validate Phase 1 functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the AudioBrowser-QML directory:
   ```bash
   cd AudioBrowserAndAnnotation/AudioBrowser-QML
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Application doesn't start
**Solution**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed and PyQt6 dependencies are available.

### Issue: No audio playback
**Solution**: 
- Check that audio file format is supported (.wav or .mp3)
- Verify system audio is working
- Check volume slider is not at 0%

### Issue: File picker doesn't work
**Solution**: This is a known Qt limitation in some environments. Type the directory path manually instead.

### Issue: Theme doesn't switch
**Solution**: 
- Try using Ctrl+T keyboard shortcut
- Check console for QML errors

## Performance Testing

### File Loading
- [ ] Test with small directory (10 files) - loads instantly
- [ ] Test with medium directory (100 files) - loads quickly
- [ ] Test with large directory (1000+ files) - acceptable load time

### Playback Performance
- [ ] Test with small WAV file (< 5 MB) - smooth playback
- [ ] Test with large WAV file (> 50 MB) - smooth playback
- [ ] Test with MP3 file - smooth playback
- [ ] Seek operations are responsive

### UI Responsiveness
- [ ] Theme switching is instant
- [ ] Tab switching is smooth
- [ ] File filtering updates immediately
- [ ] No lag when interacting with sliders

## Test Audio Files

For comprehensive testing, use:
- Small WAV file (< 5 MB)
- Large WAV file (> 50 MB)
- MP3 file with various bitrates
- Stereo audio files
- Mono audio files

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues during testing:

1. Note the exact steps to reproduce
2. Check the console output for error messages
3. Include your system information (OS, Python version, PyQt6 version)
4. Document expected vs. actual behavior

## Advanced Testing (Optional)

### Stress Testing
- [ ] Load directory with 1000+ files
- [ ] Switch files rapidly during playback
- [ ] Toggle theme repeatedly
- [ ] Seek rapidly during playback

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty directory
- [ ] Directory with no audio files
- [ ] Invalid directory path
- [ ] Audio file that fails to load
- [ ] Very short audio file (< 1 second)
- [ ] Very long audio file (> 1 hour)
