# QML Feature Parity Documentation Update - Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Task:** Update documentation to reflect actual QML implementation status  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Complete - All documentation updated

---

## What Was Done

### Problem Identified
The QML feature parity documentation was significantly out of date. It showed:
- ~70% completion
- Batch operations "in progress" 
- 12-14 weeks remaining work
- Several features marked as "not implemented" that were actually complete

### Solution Applied
Comprehensively reviewed the codebase and updated all documentation to reflect actual implementation status.

### Files Updated
1. ‚úÖ **FEATURE_COMPARISON_ORIG_VS_QML.md** - Updated all feature comparison tables
2. ‚úÖ **QML_MIGRATION_ISSUES.md** - Marked 12 of 19 issues as complete
3. ‚úÖ **QML_FEATURE_PARITY_STATUS.md** - Updated metrics and recommendations
4. ‚úÖ **QML_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md** - Updated executive summary
