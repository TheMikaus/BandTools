## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Menu text still hard to read
**Resolution**: Check if QtQuick.Controls.Basic is being used. Verify Theme.textColor is properly set.

### Issue: Dialog background is white/transparent
**Resolution**: Verify the background Rectangle is properly set in the dialog's QML file.

### Issue: Null reference errors persist
**Resolution**: Check that properties are properly passed from main.qml to dialogs. Verify backend managers are initialized before QML loads.

### Issue: Log file is empty or missing entries
**Resolution**: Check log file location. Verify logging.basicConfig is called before any logging occurs. Ensure LogViewer is created early in initialization.
