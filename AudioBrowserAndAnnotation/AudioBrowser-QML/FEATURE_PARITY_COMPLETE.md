# AudioBrowser QML - 100% Feature Parity Achievement Report

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Feature Parity**: 100%

## Executive Summary

The AudioBrowser QML application has achieved **100% feature parity** with the original PyQt Widgets application. The final missing feature - the multi-annotation sets system - has been successfully implemented, tested, and documented.

## Implementation Overview

### Problem Statement

The QML version of AudioBrowser was at 93% feature parity. The missing 7% was the **multi-annotation sets system**, a critical feature that allows:
- Multiple users to maintain separate annotation collections
- Context-specific annotations (practice vs. performance)
- Merged view to display annotations from all visible sets
- Per-set best/partial take markings

### Solution Delivered

A complete implementation of the multi-annotation sets system including:
1. **Backend infrastructure** - Full CRUD operations and persistence
2. **UI components** - Set selector, dialogs, and merged view toggle
3. **Data model updates** - Dynamic column support for merged view
4. **Comprehensive testing** - 11 automated tests, all passing
5. **User documentation** - Complete guide with best practices

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Backend (`annotation_manager.py`)

**Lines Added**: ~300

**Key Features**:
- Multi-set data structure with list of annotation sets
- Current set tracking and switching
- Show all sets toggle for merged view
- Set CRUD operations:
  - `addAnnotationSet(name, color)` - Create new sets
  - `renameAnnotationSet(set_id, name)` - Rename sets
  - `deleteAnnotationSet(set_id)` - Delete sets (min 1 protection)
  - `setAnnotationSetVisibility(set_id, visible)` - Toggle visibility
- Persistence layer:
  - `_load_annotation_sets()` - Load from disk
  - `_save_annotation_sets()` - Save to disk
  - `_convert_legacy_to_multi_set()` - Migrate old format
- Smart annotation retrieval:
  - Single set view - Current set only
  - Merged view - All visible sets with metadata
- Signals for UI updates:
  - `annotationSetsChanged` - Set list changed
  - `currentSetChanged` - Active set changed
  - `showAllSetsChanged` - Merged view toggled

### 2. Models (`models.py`)

**Lines Added**: ~100

**Key Features**:
- Merged view column definitions (`COL_MERGED_*`)
- Dynamic column count based on view mode
- Auto-detection of merged view from annotation data
- Additional roles:
  - `SetNameRole` - For displaying set names
  - `SetColorRole` - For color-coding sets
- Dynamic headers switching
- Smart data retrieval for both view modes

### 3. UI (`AnnotationsTab.qml`)

**Lines Added**: ~300

**Key Components**:
- **Annotation Set Selector**: ComboBox with auto-update
- **Set Management Buttons**:
  - "Add Set" - Opens creation dialog
  - "Rename" - Opens rename dialog
  - "Delete" - Opens confirmation dialog
- **Show All Checkbox**: Toggle merged view
- **Three Dialogs**:
  - `newSetDialog` - Create sets with name validation
  - `renameSetDialog` - Rename with current name pre-filled
  - `deleteSetDialog` - Delete with confirmation and protection
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `updateSetCombo()` - Sync UI with backend
  - Auto-refresh on set changes via Connections
- **Keyboard Integration**: Works with existing shortcuts

### 4. Integration (`main.py`)

**Lines Added**: ~7

**Key Changes**:
- Connected `annotation_manager` to `file_manager.currentDirectoryChanged`

3. ✅ Set renaming
4. ✅ Set deletion
5. ✅ Last set protection (cannot delete)
6. ✅ Current set tracking
7. ✅ Show all toggle
8. ✅ Annotation storage per set
9. ✅ Single set view
10. ✅ Merged view with metadata
11. ✅ Persistence and reload
