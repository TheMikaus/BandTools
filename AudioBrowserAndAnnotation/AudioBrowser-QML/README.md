# AudioBrowser QML Implementation

This directory contains the QML-based implementation of the AudioBrowser application. This is a phased migration from the PyQt6 Widgets-based `audio_browser.py` to a modern Qt Quick/QML architecture.

## Development Notes

- This QML implementation runs independently from the original `audio_browser.py`
- Both applications can coexist during the migration period
- The migration follows the strategy outlined in `docs/technical/QML_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md`
- Backend modules will be gradually extracted from `audio_browser.py` in Phase 1

## Architecture Patterns

### Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

- **Models (Python)**: QAbstractListModel/QAbstractTableModel for data exposure
- **Views (QML)**: Declarative UI definitions
- **ViewModels (Python)**: Business logic and coordination via QObject

### Communication

- **Python → QML**: Signals and Q_PROPERTY bindings
- **QML → Python**: Q_INVOKABLE methods and pyqtSlot decorators
- **Context Properties**: Backend objects exposed to QML via QQmlContext
