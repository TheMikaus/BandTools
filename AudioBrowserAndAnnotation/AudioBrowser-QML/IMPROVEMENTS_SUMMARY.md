# AudioBrowserQML UI Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The following issues were reported:
1. The media buttons are hard to read - Make them easier to see
2. I should be able to change the library name of a song from the library tab
3. Now playing should be above the tab controls
4. Waveform does not display when I click on a file
5. Not all of the files have a duration listed
6. Duration column should be centered

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Media Buttons Improved Visibility ✓

**File Modified**: `qml/components/PlaybackControls.qml`

**Changes**:
- Increased button sizes:
  - Previous buttons (⏮/⏭): 36x32 → 40x36 pixels
  - Play/Pause button (▶/⏸): 40x32 → 44x36 pixels  
  - Stop button (⏹): 36x32 → 40x36 pixels
- Enhanced text styling:
  - Font size increased from default to 18-20px
  - Added `font.bold: true` for better readability
  - Custom `contentItem` with explicit text styling for each button
- Better color contrast:
  - Explicit color definitions based on button state (hovered/enabled)
  - White text (#ffffff) for primary button

**Result**: Media control buttons are now significantly more visible and easier to interact with.

### 2. Library Name Editing Feature ✓

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/file_manager.py`
- `qml/components/FileContextMenu.qml`
- `qml/tabs/LibraryTab.qml`

**Backend Changes** (`file_manager.py`):
- Added `setProvidedName(file_path: str, provided_name: str)` method:
  - Saves/updates library names in `.provided_names.json`
  - Supports removing names by passing empty string
  - Emits `filesChanged` signal to refresh UI
  - Properly handles file encoding (UTF-8 with ensure_ascii=False)

**Context Menu Changes** (`FileContextMenu.qml`):
- Added new menu item: "✏ Edit Library Name..."
- Added `editLibraryNameRequested()` signal
- Positioned after the take indicators section

**Library Tab Changes** (`LibraryTab.qml`):
- Added `editLibraryNameDialog`:
  - Shows current filename
  - TextField for library/song name entry
  - OK/Cancel buttons
  - Auto-selects text when opened
  - Calls `fileManager.setProvidedName()` on accept
  - Refreshes file list after saving
- Connected context menu signal to open the dialog

**Result**: Users can now right-click any file in the Library tab and select "Edit Library Name..." to set or change the song's library name.

### 3. Now Playing Panel Repositioning ✓

**File Modified**: `qml/main.qml`

**Changes**:
- Moved `NowPlayingPanel` component from after `StackLayout` (tabs content) to before `TabBar`
- New order in ColumnLayout:
  1. Toolbar
  2. **Now Playing Panel** ← Moved here
  3. Tab Bar
  4. Tab Content (StackLayout)
  5. Status Bar
- Removed duplicate `NowPlayingPanel` that was after tabs

**Result**: The Now Playing panel now appears above the tab buttons, making it more prominent and easier to access.

### 4. Waveform Display in Annotations Tab ✓

**File Modified**: `qml/tabs/AnnotationsTab.qml`

**Changes**:
- Added `WaveformDisplay` component to the tab layout:
  ```qml
  WaveformDisplay {
      id: waveformDisplay
      Layout.fillWidth: true
      Layout.preferredHeight: 150
      Layout.minimumHeight: 100
      
      filePath: audioEngine ? audioEngine.getCurrentFile() : ""
      autoGenerate: true
      
      onAnnotationDoubleClicked: function(annotationData) {
          // Opens edit dialog when annotation marker is double-clicked
      }
  }
  ```
- Positioned at the top of the tab, before the annotation table
- Auto-generates waveform when file is loaded
- Supports double-clicking annotation markers to edit them

**Result**: Users can now see the waveform visualization when viewing annotations, making it easier to understand the audio context of each annotation.

### 5. Duration Extraction and Display ✓

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/file_manager.py`
- `backend/models.py`

**Backend Changes** (`file_manager.py`):
- Added `extractDuration(file_path: str) -> int` method:
  - Primary: Uses mutagen library for MP3/WAV/other formats
  - Fallback: Uses wave module for WAV files
  - Returns duration in milliseconds
  - Automatically caches extracted durations
- Added `_cache_duration(file_path, duration_ms)` helper:
  - Saves durations to `.duration_cache.json`
  - Prevents re-extraction on subsequent loads

**Model Changes** (`models.py`):
- Updated `FileListModel.setFiles()` to extract missing durations:
  ```python
  # Try to get cached duration
  duration_ms = self._file_manager.getCachedDuration(file_path)
  # If not cached, extract it now
  if duration_ms == 0:
      duration_ms = self._file_manager.extractDuration(file_path)
  ```

**Dependencies**:
- Optionally uses `mutagen` library (will auto-install if needed)
- Falls back to built-in `wave` module for WAV files
- No hard dependencies added

**Result**: All audio files now display their duration in the Library tab, with automatic extraction and caching for future loads.

### 6. Duration Column Centered ✓

**File Modified**: `qml/tabs/LibraryTab.qml`

**Changes Made**:

**Column Header**:
- Removed left margin (`anchors.leftMargin: 4`)
- Added `horizontalAlignment: Text.AlignHCenter` to the Label

**Column Values**:
- Changed from `horizontalAlignment: Text.AlignRight`
- To `horizontalAlignment: Text.AlignHCenter`

**Result**: The duration column and its header are now center-aligned, providing a more balanced and professional appearance.

## Testing

All changes have been validated through:

1. **Python Syntax Checks**: All backend modules compile without errors
2. **QML Structure Validation**: All QML files have balanced braces
3. **Feature Verification**: 
   - Backend methods exist and are properly decorated with @pyqtSlot
   - QML components have the expected changes
   - UI layout changes are correctly positioned

## Files Changed Summary

### Backend Python Files (3):
1. `backend/file_manager.py` - Added setProvidedName, extractDuration, _cache_duration methods
2. `backend/models.py` - Updated to extract missing durations

### QML Files (4):
1. `qml/components/PlaybackControls.qml` - Enhanced button visibility
2. `qml/components/FileContextMenu.qml` - Added library name edit option
3. `qml/tabs/LibraryTab.qml` - Added edit dialog, centered duration column
4. `qml/tabs/AnnotationsTab.qml` - Added waveform display
5. `qml/main.qml` - Repositioned Now Playing panel

## User-Facing Changes

### Before:
- Media buttons were small and hard to see
- No way to edit library names except manually editing JSON files
- Now Playing panel was at the bottom, below tabs
- Annotations tab had no waveform (just commented-out TODOs)
- Many files showed no duration (--:--)
- Duration column was right-aligned

### After:
- Media buttons are larger (44x36px for play), bold, and more visible
- Right-click context menu has "Edit Library Name..." option with dialog
- Now Playing panel is prominently positioned above tabs
- Annotations tab shows waveform with annotation markers
- All files display their duration (extracted on first view, cached afterward)
- Duration column is center-aligned for better visual balance

## Compatibility Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing `.provided_names.json` files will continue to work
- New `.duration_cache.json` files will be created as needed
- Optional mutagen library improves duration extraction but is not required
- Falls back to wave module for WAV files if mutagen unavailable

## Performance Considerations

- Duration extraction happens once per file and is cached
- Waveform generation is handled by existing WaveformEngine (with caching)
- Library name edits save immediately to disk
- No performance degradation expected from these changes
