# Multi-Cloud Sync Implementation Summary

## Overview

AudioBrowser-QML now supports synchronization with multiple cloud storage providers, allowing users to choose the best solution for their needs. This implementation extends the existing Google Drive sync to support Dropbox and WebDAV/Nextcloud as well.

     ↓
SyncManager (Unified Interface)

2. Generate access token
3. Click "Set Access Token" in AudioBrowser
4. Paste token
5. Token saved to `~/.audiobrowser/dropbox_token.json`

### WebDAV/Nextcloud Setup

2. Click "Set Credentials" in AudioBrowser
3. Enter server URL, username, password
4. Credentials saved to `~/.audiobrowser/webdav_config.json`

## API Design

### CloudSyncBase Abstract Methods

All providers must implement:
- `isAvailable()` -> bool - Check if API libraries are installed
- `isAuthenticated()` -> bool - Check authentication status
- `authenticate()` -> bool - Perform authentication
- `select_remote_folder(name)` -> str - Select/create folder
- `upload_file(local_path, remote_name)` -> bool - Upload file
- `download_file(remote_name, local_path)` -> bool - Download file
- `list_remote_files()` -> List[Dict] - List files in folder
- `performSync(directory, upload)` -> bool - Full sync operation

### SyncManager Methods

For QML integration:
- `setProvider(name)` -> bool - Switch provider
- `getProvider()` -> str - Get current provider name
- `getProviderDisplayName()` -> str - Get display name
- `isProviderAvailable(name)` -> bool - Check if provider is available
- `getAvailableProviders()` -> list - List all providers with status

Provider-specific methods:
- `dropbox_setAccessToken(token)` -> bool
- `webdav_setCredentials(hostname, username, password)` -> bool

### Qt Signals

All providers emit:
- `authenticationStatusChanged(bool, str)` - Auth success/failure
- `syncProgress(str)` - Progress messages during sync
- `syncCompleted(bool, str, int)` - Sync completion status
- `syncError(str)` - Error messages
- `folderSelected(str, str)` - Folder selection confirmation

---

## User Experience

### Provider Selection Workflow
1. User opens "Edit → Cloud Sync..." menu
2. Dialog shows provider dropdown (defaults to Google Drive)
3. User selects desired provider
4. Dialog updates to show provider-specific authentication
5. User authenticates using provider's method
6. User selects/creates remote folder
7. User can upload or download files

### Multi-Provider Usage
- Users can switch providers at any time
- Each provider has independent authentication
- Files must be manually synced to each provider
- No automatic migration between providers

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing Required
Due to the nature of cloud services, automated testing is limited. Manual testing needed:

1. **Google Drive:**
   - OAuth flow works
   - Files upload/download correctly
   - Folder creation works

2. **Dropbox:**
   - Token authentication works
   - Files upload/download to `/Apps/AudioBrowser/`
   - Error handling for invalid tokens

3. **WebDAV/Nextcloud:**
   - Basic auth works
   - Files upload/download to `/AudioBrowser/`
   - Works with Nextcloud, ownCloud, generic WebDAV

4. **Provider Switching:**
   - Can switch between providers
   - Authentication state persists
   - No data loss when switching

### Test Files Created
- `test_cloud_sync_imports.py` - Verifies module imports (requires PyQt6)

   - Compression before upload

4. **Security:**
   - Encrypted credentials storage
   - Two-factor authentication support
   - End-to-end encryption option

## Technical Decisions

### Why Abstract Base Class?
- Ensures consistent interface across providers
- Makes it easy to add new providers
- Enforces implementation of required methods
- Enables polymorphic usage in SyncManager

### Why Separate Manager?
- QML needs single point of interaction
- Providers can be swapped without QML changes
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance

### Why Not Auto-Migration?
- Each provider has different limitations
- Users may want files in specific locations
- Avoids accidental data duplication
- Gives users full control

### Why These Providers?
- **Google Drive**: Already implemented, widely used
- **Dropbox**: Simple API, good for ease of use
- **WebDAV**: Open standard, privacy-friendly, self-hostable

---

## Code Quality

### Design Principles
- **DRY**: Common code in base class
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one job
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to add providers without modifying existing code
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstraction (CloudSyncBase), not concrete classes

### Code Organization
- Clear module boundaries
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Type hints where appropriate

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for missing dependencies
- User-friendly error messages
- Signals for async error reporting
- Logging for debugging

---

## Dependencies

### Python Packages
All packages are optional (auto-install pattern not yet implemented):

**Google Drive:**
```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```

**Dropbox:**
```bash
pip install dropbox
```

**WebDAV:**
```bash
pip install webdavclient3
```

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6 (already required by AudioBrowser)
- Internet connection for sync operations

---

## Performance Considerations

### Network Usage
- Files transferred one at a time (no parallelization yet)
- Progress reported for each file
- Large files may take significant time

### Storage
- Local: No additional storage (uses existing audio files)
- Remote: Depends on provider's storage limits
- Metadata files are small (< 1 MB typically)

### CPU/Memory
- Minimal overhead for sync operations
- Main cost is network I/O
- No significant performance impact on audio playback

---

## Security Considerations

### Credentials Storage
- Google Drive: OAuth token in `~/.audiobrowser/token.json`
- Dropbox: Access token in `~/.audiobrowser/dropbox_token.json`
- WebDAV: Credentials in `~/.audiobrowser/webdav_config.json` (plain text)

**Recommendation**: Use file system permissions to protect these files:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.audiobrowser/*.json
```

### Data in Transit
- All providers use HTTPS
- TLS encryption for all transfers
- No plaintext credentials over network

### Data at Rest
- Google Drive: Encrypted by Google
- Dropbox: Encrypted by Dropbox
- WebDAV: Depends on server configuration

---

## Conclusion

This implementation provides AudioBrowser users with flexible cloud sync options while maintaining backward compatibility and a consistent user experience. The modular architecture makes it easy to add more providers in the future, and comprehensive documentation ensures users can set up and use any provider successfully.
