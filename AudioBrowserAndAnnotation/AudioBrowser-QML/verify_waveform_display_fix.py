╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

This script will guide you through verifying the waveform display fix.
Please follow the steps below and check each item as you go.

PREREQUISITES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ AudioBrowserQML application is installed
□ You have sample audio files (WAV or MP3)
□ You are running in a GUI environment (not headless)

STEP 1: LAUNCH APPLICATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Run: python3 main.py
□ Application window opens successfully
□ Main window shows tabs: Library, Annotations, Clips, etc.

STEP 2: SELECT AUDIO FILE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Click on "Library" tab
□ Navigate to a folder with audio files
□ Click on an audio file to select it
□ File name appears in "Now Playing" area

STEP 3: CHECK ANNOTATIONS TAB
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Click on "Annotations" tab
□ Waveform display area is visible at top
□ Initial state: Shows message or loading indicator

STEP 4: VERIFY WAVEFORM APPEARS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL - This is what the fix addresses:

□ Waveform peaks appear (vertical blue lines)
□ Waveform fills the display area
□ Gray horizontal line (center axis) is visible
□ Background is dark (dark theme)
□ Waveform color is blue (Theme.accentPrimary)

VISUAL REFERENCE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Waveform Display                            │
│ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │
│ ▁▂▃▅▇█▇▅▃▂▁ ▁▂▃▅▇█▇▅▃▂▁ (blue peaks)      │
│ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

IF WAVEFORM DOESN'T APPEAR:
- Wait 5-30 seconds for first-time generation
- Check for loading indicator and progress bar
- Check console for error messages
- Try a different audio file (preferably WAV)
- Verify FFmpeg is installed (for MP3 files)

STEP 5: TEST PLAYBACK POSITION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Click play button (or press Space)
□ Red vertical line (playhead) appears on waveform
□ Playhead moves smoothly from left to right
□ Playhead position matches audio playback
□ Playhead updates approximately 20 times per second

VISUAL REFERENCE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Waveform Display                            │
│ ━━━━━━━━━━│━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │
│ ▁▂▃▅▇█▇▅▃▂│▁ ▁▂▃▅▇█▇▅▃▂▁                 │
│ ━━━━━━━━━━│━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │
│           ↑ red playhead                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 6: TEST CLICK-TO-SEEK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Click anywhere on the waveform
□ Playhead jumps to clicked position
□ Audio playback seeks to that position
□ Multiple clicks work correctly

STEP 7: TEST DIFFERENT FILES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Return to Library tab
□ Select a different audio file
□ Return to Annotations tab
□ Waveform updates to show new file
□ Previous waveform is replaced
□ New waveform displays correctly

STEP 8: TEST EDGE CASES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Test with very short file (<10 seconds)
□ Test with long file (>5 minutes)
□ Test with quiet file (low amplitude)
□ Test with loud file (high amplitude)
□ All waveforms display correctly

STEP 9: TEST CACHED WAVEFORMS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Select a file you've already viewed
□ Waveform appears instantly (no generation delay)
□ Waveform is identical to first time
□ No loading indicator shown

STEP 10: VERIFY VISUAL QUALITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Waveform lines are smooth (antialiasing enabled)
□ No jagged edges on vertical lines
□ Colors are correct (blue waveform, red playhead, gray axis)
□ No visual artifacts or glitches
□ Waveform scales properly with window resize

TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ISSUE: Waveform area is completely blank
FIX: 
  - Check console for Python errors
  - Verify audio file is actually selected
  - Wait for initial generation (may take 30 seconds)
  - Try selecting file again

ISSUE: Waveform shows only horizontal line
FIX:
  - Check if audio file is silent
  - Try a different audio file
  - Check console for generation errors

ISSUE: Playhead doesn't move during playback
FIX:
  - Check if audio is actually playing
  - Check console for timer errors
  - Try stopping and restarting playback

ISSUE: Waveform looks pixelated or jagged
FIX:
  - This is unexpected (antialiasing should be enabled)
  - Check if OpenGL/GPU acceleration is working
  - Report as a separate issue

ISSUE: Performance is slow
FIX:
  - Check file size (very large files may be slow)
  - Wait for initial generation to complete
  - Subsequent loads should be fast (cached)

EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
When waveform loads, you might see:
  [WaveformEngine] Generating waveform for: /path/to/file.wav
  [WaveformEngine] Waveform generation complete: 2000 peaks
  [WaveformEngine] Cached waveform for: /path/to/file.wav

No errors or warnings should appear related to:
  - peaksChanged signal
  - Property binding
  - QML property updates
  - WaveformView rendering

VERIFICATION COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If all checkboxes above are checked ✓, the waveform display fix is verified
as working correctly. The fix successfully added NOTIFY signals to enable
QML property updates, and waveforms now display as expected.
