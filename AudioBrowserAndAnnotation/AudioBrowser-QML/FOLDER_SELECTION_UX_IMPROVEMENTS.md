# Folder Selection UX Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the UX improvements made to the folder selection and navigation workflow in the AudioBrowser QML application.

## Problem Statement

The user reported several UX issues:
1. **Folder notes not loading**: Selecting a folder in the Library tab didn't load the folder notes for that folder
2. **Docs folders visible**: Documentation folders were cluttering the folder tree view
3. **Delayed file loading**: Had to double-click files to load them, making the workflow clunky when wanting to quickly review annotations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Filter "docs" Folders from Folder Tree

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/file_manager.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `getDirectoriesWithAudioFiles()` method (line 429) to exclude folders named "docs"
- Updated `discoverAudioFilesRecursive()` method (line 161) to exclude folders named "docs"

**Impact:**
- Documentation folders are now automatically hidden from the folder tree
- Cleaner, less cluttered folder view
- Both root-level and nested "docs" folders are filtered

### 2. Auto-load Folder Notes on Folder Selection

**Files Modified:**
- `qml/tabs/LibraryTab.qml`

**Changes:**
- Added call to `folderNotesManager.loadNotesForFolder(model.path)` in the folder click handler (lines 340-342)

**Impact:**
- When clicking a folder in the Library tab, its folder notes are automatically loaded
- Users can immediately switch to the Folder Notes tab to view/edit notes
- Seamless workflow between folder browsing and note management

### 3. Load Audio File on Single Click

**Files Modified:**
- `qml/tabs/LibraryTab.qml`

**Changes:**
- Modified file click handler to load the audio file on single left-click (lines 683-685)
- Preserved double-click behavior for load-and-play
- Preserved right-click behavior for context menu

**Impact:**
- Single-clicking a file now loads it into the audio engine
- Files are immediately ready to view in the Annotations tab
- Improved workflow: click file → switch to Annotations tab → see waveform/annotations immediately
- No need to wait for double-click or manual loading

### 4. Updated Documentation

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/user_guides/FOLDER_NAVIGATION.md`

**Changes:**
- Documented that folder selection loads folder notes
- Documented that single-click loads files for viewing
- Documented that "docs" folders are filtered
- Updated troubleshooting section

## User Workflow Improvements

### Before Changes:
1. Click folder → files list updates
2. Switch to Folder Notes tab → notes are empty (old folder's notes)
3. Double-click file → file loads and plays
4. Switch to Annotations tab → can view waveform
5. Manual back-and-forth between tabs to see file list and annotations

### After Changes:
1. Click folder → files list updates + folder notes automatically load
2. Switch to Folder Notes tab → see notes for current folder immediately
3. Single-click file → file loads (ready to view)
4. Switch to Annotations tab → waveform ready immediately
5. Quick iteration through songs by switching back to Library tab

## Testing

All changes have been validated with:

1. **Existing Tests**: All folder tree tests pass
2. **Custom Integration Test**: Created comprehensive test verifying:
   - Docs folders are filtered from `getDirectoriesWithAudioFiles()`
   - Docs folders are filtered from `discoverAudioFilesRecursive()`
   - Nested docs folders are also filtered
   - Folder notes manager correctly loads notes for folders
   - Signal emissions work correctly

## Technical Details

### Backend Changes (Python)

```python
# file_manager.py - Line 429
# Before:
if item.is_dir() and not item.name.startswith('.'):

# After:
if item.is_dir() and not item.name.startswith('.') and item.name != 'docs':
```

### Frontend Changes (QML)

```qml
// LibraryTab.qml - Folder click handler (lines 340-342)
// Added:
if (folderNotesManager) {
    folderNotesManager.loadNotesForFolder(model.path)
}

// LibraryTab.qml - File click handler (lines 683-685)
// Added:
else {
    // Load file on single left-click so it's ready to view in Annotations tab
    audioEngine.loadFile(model.filepath)
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are fully backward compatible:
- Existing metadata files continue to work
- No changes to file formats or data structures
- Only UI behavior changes, no API changes
- Existing workflows still work (double-click to play, etc.)

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact
- Folder filtering happens during tree scan (already in progress)
- Folder notes loading is asynchronous
- File loading on click is the same operation as before, just triggered earlier

## Future Considerations

Potential future enhancements:
1. Allow users to configure which folder names to filter (not just "docs")
2. Add a "show all folders" option to bypass filtering
3. Implement split-screen view to see file list and annotations simultaneously
4. Add keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation between tabs

## Conclusion

These changes significantly improve the folder selection and file browsing workflow by:
- Reducing clutter (hiding docs folders)
- Automating common tasks (loading folder notes)
- Speeding up the workflow (single-click file loading)
- Making the UI more responsive and intuitive

All changes have been tested and documented, with no breaking changes to existing functionality.
