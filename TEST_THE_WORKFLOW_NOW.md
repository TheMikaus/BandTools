# üöÄ READY TO TEST - Click the Link Below!

## The workflow has been fixed! Here's how to verify it works:

### Quick Test (Click this link):
**Direct link to trigger the workflow:**

```
https://github.com/TheMikaus/BandTools/actions/workflows/build-polyrhythm-apk.yml
```

### Steps:
1. Click the link above (or go to Actions tab ‚Üí "Build PolyRhythmMetronome APK")
2. Click the green "Run workflow" button
3. Select branch: `copilot/fix-chown-invalid-user-error`
4. Leave the defaults and click "Run workflow"
5. Wait 30-60 minutes for the build
6. Download the APK from Artifacts section

---

## What was fixed?

The error **"chown: invalid user: 'user'"** was caused by this problematic code:
```yaml
- name: Fix permissions for buildozer user
  run: |
    sudo chown -R 1000:1000 .
```

This tried to change ownership to UID 1000, but the buildozer-action Docker container runs as a different user, causing the error.

### The fix:
- ‚úÖ Removed the `sudo chown` command entirely
- ‚úÖ Removed unnecessary `sudo` from directory creation
- ‚úÖ Simplified to just `chmod 777` on needed directories
- ‚úÖ The buildozer-action handles permissions internally

---

## Expected Build Timeline

‚è±Ô∏è **First build**: 30-60 minutes
- Downloads Android SDK (~2GB)
- Downloads Android NDK (~1GB)
- Downloads Python-for-Android toolchain

‚è±Ô∏è **Subsequent builds**: 10-20 minutes (with caching)

---

## Success Indicators

When the workflow succeeds, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ All steps complete with green checkmarks
- ‚úÖ "android-build" artifact appears at the bottom
- ‚úÖ APK file can be downloaded and installed

---

## If it works:

Merge this PR and the build system is fixed! üéâ

The workflow will be ready for:
- Manual builds anytime via Actions tab
- Automatic builds on push (if configured)
- Release builds with tagged versions
