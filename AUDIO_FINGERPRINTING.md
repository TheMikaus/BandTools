# Audio Fingerprinting Feature Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the audio fingerprinting feature implemented for the AudioBrowser application. The feature enables automatic identification and labeling of audio files based on their spectral characteristics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Audio Fingerprinting Algorithm
- **Spectral Analysis**: Uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to analyze frequency content
- **Frequency Bands**: Divides spectrum into 12-16 frequency bands for feature extraction
- **Temporal Segments**: Processes overlapping audio segments for robust matching
- **Normalization**: Volume-independent fingerprints using energy normalization
- **Windowing**: Applies Hanning window to reduce spectral leakage

### 2. Similarity Matching
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between fingerprint vectors
- **Configurable Threshold**: 50-95% matching threshold (default 70%)
- **Partial Matching**: Handles variations in recording quality and length
- **Best Match Selection**: Finds closest match above threshold

### 3. User Interface Components
- **Practice Folder Discovery**: Automatically finds all folders with fingerprints
- **Threshold Control**: Slider to adjust matching sensitivity (50-95%, default 70%)
- **Generate Fingerprints Button**: Create fingerprints for current folder
- **Auto-Label Button**: Automatically suggest names based on cross-folder matches
- **Show Practice Folders Button**: Display detailed information about available practice folders
- **Status Display**: Shows current folder fingerprints and available songs for matching

### 4. Cross-Folder Matching System
- **Automatic Discovery**: Finds all practice folders with fingerprint caches
- **Unique Song Prioritization**: Prioritizes songs that appear in only one folder for reliable identification
- **Multi-Folder Handling**: Can still match songs that appear in multiple folders
- **Source Attribution**: Shows which folder each match came from
- **Detailed Results**: Provides comprehensive feedback on matching process

### 5. Caching System
- **JSON Storage**: Fingerprints stored in `.audio_fingerprints.json` files
- **File Integrity**: Uses file size and modification time for cache validation
- **Per-Folder Cache**: Separate cache files for each directory
- **Automatic Updates**: Regenerates fingerprints when files change

## File Structure

### Modified Files
- `AudioBrowserAndAnnotation/audio_browser.py`: Main implementation

### New Cache Files (created automatically)
- `.audio_fingerprints.json`: Fingerprint cache per directory

Collects fingerprints from multiple folders and organizes by filename.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `folder_paths`: List of directories to scan for fingerprints
  - `exclude_dir`: Optional directory to exclude from collection
- **Returns**: Dictionary mapping filename to list of fingerprint entries with folder information

#### `find_best_cross_folder_match(target_fingerprint: List[float], fingerprint_map: Dict, threshold: float) -> Optional[Tuple[str, float, Path]]`
Finds the best match for a target fingerprint across multiple folders, prioritizing unique songs.
- **Parameters**:
  - `target_fingerprint`: The fingerprint to match against
  - `fingerprint_map`: Dictionary from `collect_fingerprints_from_folders`
  - `threshold`: Minimum similarity threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Returns**: Tuple of (filename, similarity_score, source_folder) or None

### UI Methods

#### `_select_fingerprint_reference_folder()`
Opens dialog to select reference folder containing named songs. (Legacy - now optional as system auto-discovers practice folders)

#### `_generate_fingerprints_for_folder()`
Generates fingerprints for all audio files in current folder.

#### `_auto_label_with_fingerprints()`
Automatically labels unlabeled files based on cross-folder fingerprint matching. Now searches across all practice folders automatically.

#### `_show_practice_folders_info()`
Shows detailed information about discovered practice folders and available fingerprints for matching.

#### `_update_fingerprint_ui()`
Updates UI elements to reflect current fingerprint state and available practice folders.

## Configuration

### Settings (stored in QSettings)
- `fingerprint_reference_dir`: Path to reference folder (optional - used as fallback if no practice folders found)
- `fingerprint_match_threshold`: Matching threshold (0.0-1.0, default 0.7)

### Constants
- `FINGERPRINTS_JSON = ".audio_fingerprints.json"`: Cache filename
- `SETTINGS_KEY_FINGERPRINT_DIR`: Settings key for reference directory
- `SETTINGS_KEY_FINGERPRINT_THRESHOLD`: Settings key for threshold

## Usage Workflow

### Cross-Folder Matching (New - Recommended)
1. **Generate fingerprints** for multiple practice session folders as you create recordings
2. **Navigate** to any folder with unlabeled practice recordings
3. **Click "Auto-Label Files"** - the system automatically discovers and uses fingerprints from all practice folders
4. **Review results** - the system prioritizes songs that appear in only one folder for most reliable identification
5. **Use "Show Practice Folders"** button to see detailed information about available fingerprints
6. **Use existing "Batch Rename"** feature to apply final names

### Legacy Reference Folder Workflow
1. Select a reference folder containing named audio files
2. Click "Generate Fingerprints..." to create reference fingerprints
3. Adjust threshold if needed (70% recommended)
4. Navigate to folder with unlabeled practice recordings
5. Click "Auto-Label Files" to get name suggestions based on reference folder
6. Review and edit suggested names as needed

### Key Advantages of Cross-Folder Matching
- **No reference folder needed** - works with any practice folders that have fingerprints
- **Unique song prioritization** - songs appearing in only one folder provide most reliable identification
- **Automatic discovery** - finds all practice folders with fingerprints automatically
- **Detailed feedback** - shows which folder each match came from and whether it's unique

## Technical Details
